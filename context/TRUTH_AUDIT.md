# Truth Audit

## 2026-07-19 — Session 75

- Audit truth: all 14 newly verified findings are shipped; the cumulative JSON sidecar is 37/37 shipped and Markdown is derived from it. The regenerated innovation pack is 6/6 with three new candidates implemented after primary exhaustion.
- Test truth: direct `npm test` passes 134 main files / 814 tests and independently repeats 31 server files / 119 tests. Playwright passes 24/24 desktop/mobile tests, including lazy Command Center loading and mobile drawer accessibility.
- Build truth: lint and TypeScript pass. Production build passes after Command Center was split into an 11.23 kB on-demand chunk; exact initial gzip is 740,285 bytes and Brotli is 588,036 bytes, both below enforced variance limits. Formatting and media/per-chunk budgets pass.
- Match truth: progression, archive, metrics, and certified post-match AI derive from one strict unique-IP-majority result certificate. No client projection substitutes for the certificate.
- AI truth: oracle inputs come from server-owned rating history; post-match inputs come from archived certified records. Provider output is schema-validated, deadline-bounded, cache-bounded, and receipt-digested with exact model identity.
- Release truth: the generated artifact is blocked, not ready. Eight canonical gates require fresh source/digest provenance; local footer/health/transfer/work gates pass, while staging, parity, Brevo, Obelisk, live themes, human Alpha evidence, and founder approval remain absent. The working-tree blocker is expected until the closeout commit.
- Agent truth: six capabilities are reachable in checked-in source and published as `implemented-local-unlaunched`; `public/agents.json` still declares `publicRuntime: unavailable` and advertises no executable live agent interactions.
- Doctor truth: direct process exit is 0 with 7/7 probes passing, no warnings, and `blockingFailing: 0`. Work exhaustion is audit 37/37 and innovation 6/6.
- Cost truth: remote AI remains optional/default-off and bounded under the notional flat-rate plan posture; no spend alarm or fabricated cost event was introduced.
- Launch truth: no staging deployment, human session, email delivery, relying-party auth, live web/theme evidence, revenue event, or founder approval is claimed.

| Contradiction density     |     4 | Local surfaces agree; central registry audience/type and release-gate shape still need the already-shipped Ark correction. |

**Genome total:** 24/25 — green. The one-point deduction is cross-repo metadata drift, not hidden local inconsistency.

## 2026-07-16 — Session 74

- Work truth: the latest audit sidecar contains 23/23 shipped entries, including 11 newly implemented findings; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` contains 3/3 shipped innovations. `check-work-exhaustion.mjs` returns `ok: true` with no pending unblocked IDs.
- Authority truth: all inventoried state-changing HTTP routes cross the shared verified-actor policy; contract tests cover the route inventory and actor/role decisions. This does not claim native Obelisk relying-party integration.
- Experiment truth: assignment is server-owned; accepted values are literal unit events with UUID identity and deduplication; invalid/duplicate/spoofed attempts are counted separately.
- Health truth: readiness is process-local and derives from HTTP, IPC freshness, and game-loop freshness. WebSocket payload, IP, spectator, worker, and buffered-byte limits are explicit policy values.
- Remote-AI truth: reservations are placed only after authentication, validation, and cache lookup, immediately before provider-bound work. Posture explicitly says `process-local-per-worker`; counters are not a global distributed quota.
- Build truth: TypeScript and warning-free Vite production build pass. The checked-in Windows baseline is 738,885 gzip bytes and 586,751 Brotli bytes; the gate permits an explicit 1% cross-platform compression envelope because zlib output differs slightly on Linux while preserving the exact baseline. Windows actual transfer is 738,884 gzip / 586,665 Brotli bytes; media aggregate and largest-artifact budgets pass. The Release Evidence Manifest reports both baseline/envelope and audit/innovation exhaustion.
- Test truth: the broad run passes 122 files / 762 unique tests; the server subset independently repeats 25 files / 90 tests; Playwright passes 22/22 desktop/mobile tests with two bounded local workers.
- Tooling truth: project doctor runs four real checks with `blockingFailing: 0`; formatting ratchet and lint pass after touched-file correction; sitemap compliance is 10/10 and Canon conformance reports zero gaps/zero absolute gaps.
- Security truth: settings sanitization found zero issues. The full-tree entropy scanner reports low-confidence false positives in inherited binary/base64 assets, so it is not claimed green; the authoritative staged-diff scan passed with zero findings.
- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO. Studio Ops `release-gate` currently throws because registry `testing` is not an array, web hardening sees zero public origins, and the central cost gate still calls this project `exempt-internal`; signed Ark cargo requests control-plane correction. No sibling repo was edited.
- SIL truth: 968/1000 is the exact sum of 10 categories. Engagement and ecosystem scores remain bounded by absent real-human and external integration evidence.

## 2026-07-16 — Session 73

- Audit truth: all 12 items in `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-16.json` are marked shipped with per-item execution evidence; the Markdown audit is derived from that JSON. All 3 second-order innovation candidates are evidence-detected complete.
- Test truth: the final coverage run passed 107/107 files and 697/697 tests. The exact single-worker CI Playwright profile passed 22/22 desktop/mobile tests. A faster six-worker local stress run had two cold-start timeouts; both passed immediately in isolation and the canonical CI profile passed without retry.
- Build truth: TypeScript and Vite 7 production build pass. Every emitted JavaScript chunk is below 500 kB gzip under the dependency-free bundle gate. Remaining warnings are explicit: public URL placeholders are unset before deployment, two JSON import-attribute inconsistencies remain, and the manual chunk layout reports one circular-chunk warning.
- Security truth: authenticated/deduplicated source-labeled Alpha Gate evidence, fail-closed signed replay consumption, and authenticated sanitized rematch creation are covered. `npm audit` reports zero vulnerabilities after exact trust-gated updates; Studio supply-chain scan reports zero matching incidents.
- Cost truth: remote AI is default-off and requires an explicit positive hourly cap with feature attribution. Deterministic coaching remains the cost-neutral baseline.
- Public truth: local sitemap compliance is 10/10 and public/AI-agent/legal/contact surfaces exist, but this does not prove live hosting, email delivery, headers, Core Web Vitals, or theme readability.
- Canon/doctor truth: conformance reports 49 applicable Canon, zero gaps, and zero absolute gaps. Studio doctor reports `overallPass: true`, 112 passing, 33 advisory warnings, zero failing, and `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Profile truth: local status is `game/public-unlaunched`; signed Ark cargo `01JTM66B6TEE83C483CEB936FA` requests the registry type correction from `app` to `game`. No direct sibling-repo edit was made.
- Launch truth: no human Alpha Gate, staging parity, project-domain Brevo delivery, native Obelisk relying-party auth, live CSP/HSTS/Core Web Vitals/theme screenshot evidence, revenue event, or founder approval is claimed.
- SIL truth: score is recalibrated from an unsupported 999 to evidence-based 943/1000. The decrease is an honesty correction, not a product regression.

## 2026-07-16

- Recovery provenance: the immediate prior run stopped during `/start`; the inherited dirty layer matched a June 18 `lint-staged` recovery stash plus later Studio protocol propagation. No new audit or implementation had begun.
- Integrity truth: changed/untracked JSON parses; 53 changed/untracked scripts pass `node --check`; the Studio Claude-config guard reports valid configuration and zero corruption events in the prior 24 hours.
- Obelisk truth: the committed React `.tsx` helper was unreferenced and incompatible with this Lit project, failing TypeScript because React/JSX are not configured. All deployable Obelisk stubs were removed; `obelisk-passport/` remains local and ignored after being untracked.
- Verification truth: direct `npm test` passes 94 main files / 655 tests plus 10 server files / 30 tests. Studio doctor reports `overallPass: true`, 115 passing, 25 advisory warnings, 2 expected skips, and `blockingFailing: 0`. The local staging build initially failed on the React stub, proving the earlier build claim stale; the repaired local staging gate now passes `npm run build-prod` with TypeScript clean.
- Commit-gate truth: the recovery pre-commit hook initially reproduced three inherited lint failures; Obelisk TTL fallback, ANSI stripping, and CommonJS script lint configuration were fixed at source with focused ESLint green and no hook bypass.
- Sanitization truth: `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` is preserved locally but untracked/ignored; the root AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE` remains public and the upstream copyleft obligation is unchanged.
- Residual truth: live rivalry/rematch playtest evidence, observed revenue, production Obelisk relying-party registration, and route/server verification remain unclaimed.

## 2026-06-14

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14_S71.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped protocol helper guard changes and mark all 3 items shipped.
- Studio protocol truth: `tests/scripts/StudioProtocolHelpers.test.ts` covers stale startup brief rejection, per-tile budget attribution/trimming, and secrets-gateway capability readiness.
- PROJECT_STATUS invariant truth: `scripts/lib/write-project-status.mjs --check` passes after restoring the shared SIL v3 category list in `scripts/lib/sil-categories.mjs`.
- Obelisk truth: generated `obelisk-passport/` stubs remain local/ignored until production relying-party origin registration and deliberate auth wiring.
- Broad test evidence is now 94 main test files / 655 tests plus 10 server test files / 30 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 3 items shipped.
- Alpha Gate runbook truth: `VaultFrontAlphaGateRunbook` turns pulse/readiness payloads into checklist, success criteria, evidence fields, and warnings without clearing revenue evidence.
- Readiness truth: playtest-pulse evidence now includes the alpha gate pass label in warning and pass branches.
- Studio protocol truth: `generate-genius-list.mjs --json` has focused regression coverage for done-item semantics and human-blocked live-evidence gates.
- Broad test evidence is now 93 main test files / 652 tests plus 10 server test files / 30 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-13

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-13_S69.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark the 2 product items plus truth sync shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary payloads now include `alphaGate` with freshness, tutorial, feedback, Rival exposure, and Rival action checks.
- Readiness truth: a ready pulse score now remains warning-level unless the attached alpha gate is also ready.
- KPI tile truth: the Playtest Pulse tile now renders Alpha Gate status and the next missing check.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 647 tests plus 9 server test files / 27 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-07

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-07_S68.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark the 2 product items shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary payloads now include `operatorNext` with headline, steps, and successMetric derived from the same pulse counters used by readiness.
- KPI tile truth: the Playtest Pulse tile now renders Rival Challenge action conversion, latest signal age, and `operatorNext.headline`.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 645 tests plus 9 server test files / 25 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.
- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-07_S67.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary totals/rates now include tutorial advancement, match feedback, and Rival Challenge retention conversion counters.
- Readiness truth: playtest-pulse evidence includes the first action insight, so launch-gate warnings name the next playtest action.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 643 tests plus 9 server test files / 24 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, and large chunks.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`; the helper validation command hit an intermittent Windows sandbox `CryptUnprotectData` error during closeout, so this invariant was verified from the JSON fields directly.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-05

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-05_S66.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Startup helper-chain truth: `node scripts/compact-handoff.mjs` and `node scripts/render-startup-brief.mjs` now pass after restoring missing helper modules.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 640 tests plus 9 server test files / 23 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, and large chunks.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`.
- `.ops-cache/` is ignored with `.cache/` so generated handoff cache does not create false dirty-worktree signals.
- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-05_S65.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Fresh Codex closeout verification passed: blocker script syntax checks, blocker-preflight rendering, readiness focused Vitest (4 tests), production build, and broad `npm test`.
- Broad test evidence is now 90 main test files / 638 tests plus 9 server test files / 23 tests.
- Generated `.cache/` and `ignis/output/` artifacts are ignored so they do not create false dirty-worktree signals during session protocol runs.
- Known non-blocking warnings remain: Vite public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and expected test stderr paths.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-04

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-04_S64.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes.
- All 90 Vitest test files (637 tests) pass — broad `npm test` is now fully green. Previous 3 pre-existing failures (VaultFrontExecution mock staleness, VaultFrontLifecycle BigInt, CoachHintEngine trigger field) are repaired.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run build-prod` green (Vite bundled in 13.4s); touched-file ESLint clean.
- Entropy: 0.08 (healthy, computed and written to PROJECT_STATUS.json).
- Session 65 truth sync: `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` now matches the latest public-safe Session 65 estimate (997), and test evidence now says 638 tests instead of stale 634/637.
- Revenue signal remains unverified. The readiness/startup code can now clear the warning only when explicit observed/verified evidence is supplied; it must not clear on `unverified`.
- Truth status upgraded from amber-green to green — all major verification surfaces are now clean.

## 2026-06-03

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-03_S63.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; CI-style serial `npm run e2e` passes with one flaky retry.
- Focused pulse/readiness/tournament tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` and touched-file ESLint pass.
- Broad `npm test` is not green due 3 residual non-touched failures in `VaultFrontExecution` and `CoachHintEngine`; project status should not claim full unit surface green until repaired.

## 2026-05-18

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-05-18.md` matches shipped code/test changes.
- Startup brief regenerated successfully after helper repair.
- Full lint/build are not green yet due unrelated pre-existing blockers; focused modified-file checks passed.

## 2026-07-20 — Session 76 truth audit

- docs/AUDIT_2026-07-20.json is the latest audit source: 5 total, 5 shipped, 0 pending.
- docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json is evidence-derived and reports 9 total, 9 shipped, 0 pending.
- Startup context usage is derived from tokens/limit; the live brief prints approximately 3%, not the former contradictory 80%.
- SIL history parses five current sessions and produces a nonzero evidence-backed forecast; the validator rejects a 0/1000 numeric claim.
- context/PROJECT_STATUS.json and context/STUDIO_MANIFEST.json agree on game / alpha / public-unlaunched. Their identity, public metadata, footer topology, and immutable deploy sources are represented by static/release-evidence.json projectTruth.fingerprint.
- Footer truth is scoped and non-vacuous: 10 pages, 4 header destinations, 7 footer destinations, with every header/footer-only/legal route present in each leaf footer.
- Deployment truth is staging-only plus explicit digest promotion; scripts/check-deploy-contract.mjs passes 25 checks including rollback receipt requirements.
- Release evidence is exhausted and transfer-budget green but remains blocked on absent staging/parity, Brevo, Obelisk, live theme, founder approval, and distinct-human Alpha evidence. Dirty source remains a blocker until the closeout commit.
- Verification observed directly: 134 Vitest files / 822 tests, independent 31-file / 121-test server repeat, lint green, production build green, Playwright 24/24, and project doctor 7/7 with blockingFailing: 0.
- Signed Ark cargos 01JU1AEATS46E1C7F5DD9AE41C and 01JU1AF6P1EF704DF81B654BAB carry the canonical correction request and reusable pattern. No sibling implementation tree was edited.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 77 recovery truth audit

- `classify-recovery-provenance.mjs` reports no corruption, unresolved merge markers, or lint-staged backup ambiguity.
- Session 76's product/runtime closeout is committed at `22c2b3a6`; Session 77 contained only uncommitted startup/protocol state before recovery verification.
- There were no untracked files and no changed JSON/NDJSON inputs before doctor refreshed `PROJECT_STATUS.json`; the refreshed JSON parses.
- `~/.claude.json` passes native JSON parsing, and the canonical guard reports zero corruption events in the prior 24 hours.
- The first `npm test` red was one fixed-timeout failure, not an assertion mismatch. The exact test passed alone in 0.9 seconds and the next direct full run passed 134/134 files, 822/822 tests, 31/31 server files, and 121/121 server tests.
- Project doctor directly passed seven executable checks with `blockingFailing: 0`.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 78 product-truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-21.json` contains 9 items: 7 shipped locally and 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`; no pending unblocked item remains.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 11/11 evidence-derived innovations shipped, including external-block taxonomy parity and local-theme-proof freshness enforcement.
- Prediction League resolution now consumes only certified match progression evidence and is process-idempotent; its receipt records actual outcome and resolved prediction count.
- First-run truth has one shared four-action First Extraction vocabulary; advanced coachmarks cannot appear or complete before it clears; two unmounted client tutorial paths were removed.
- Convoy Mastery persists one typed prescription across recap, debrief, and HUD; malformed local state fails closed.
- Startup brief truth reports `Last active: 0d` and `Avg3: 980.3` from typed evidence; impossible activity ages are semantic failures.
- All 10 manifest pages are generator-owned and pass idempotent shell check plus scoped 4-header/7-footer validation.
- `docs/THEME_LOCAL_PROOF.json` contains six local-only theme/viewport cells and twelve captured surfaces. Every checked token pair exceeds 4.5 contrast; the doctor rejects stale, incomplete, low-contrast, or non-local claims.
- Full verification passed: 139 main files / 840 tests, independent 32 server files / 124 tests, TypeScript, production Vite build, focused Playwright theme matrix, Prettier ratchet, work exhaustion, and doctor 8/8 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Cloudflare deploy and Brevo capabilities are READY. No external staging target, parity, native Obelisk, human Alpha, revenue, or founder evidence was fabricated or inferred.
- Closeout helper discovery unexpectedly mutated the Studio Ops default target because `--help` was not side-effect-free. Read-only sibling status identified a dirty tree with concurrent/unknown provenance; Ark cargo `01JU3V1GUP49DF58394CEE8244` reports likely affected paths for owner reconciliation. VaultFront did not edit or revert the sibling directly.

## 2026-07-22 — Session 79 certified-mastery truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-22.json` contains 8 items: 6 shipped locally, 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`, and 0 pending unblocked.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 14/14 evidence-derived innovations shipped; three were generated and implemented this session.
- Daily Mastery reads only authenticated identity and certified match envelopes. PostgreSQL enforces one event per player/game/UTC-day and credits a persistent wallet once; the no-database fallback reports `process-local` scope.
- The browser graph reports 181/181 production client modules reachable and eleven former orphans were deleted. Historical audit prose remains historical evidence, not a runtime claim.
- Every project-status writer passes the atomic-path scanner. Four startup/doctor callers no longer write the JSON directly.
- Coverage enumerates production TypeScript rather than only loaded files: global 29.88% lines / 29.63% statements / 28.57% functions / 24.77% branches; Worker is honestly visible at 0%; ten critical modules have measured floors.
- Release evidence reports work `exhausted=true`, transfer `pass`, and launch `blocked` on eight real observations/dirty-source state. It no longer misclassifies evidenced external corridors as pending work.
- Direct verification passed: 143 Vitest files / 856 tests, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, 26/26 Playwright desktop/mobile tests, 38 deploy-contract checks, and project doctor 10/10 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Remote E2E bootstrap is corrected locally but no post-push GitHub run is claimed green yet.
- No external staging, native Obelisk relying-party, project-domain Brevo delivery, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback observation, or founder approval was fabricated.

## 2026-07-22 — Session 80 durable-evidence truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-22.json` contains 11 items: 9 shipped locally across Sessions 79–80, 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`, and 0 pending unblocked.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 17/17 evidence-derived innovations shipped; three retention/risk/validator invariants were generated and implemented this session.
- Alpha evidence is durable only when PostgreSQL is available. A configured-but-unavailable database fails closed; an unconfigured development runtime reports `process-local`.
- Public playtest summaries omit actor keys, session IDs, and event IDs; release gates read a 24-hour cohort, while stored actor-bound evidence expires after 30 days.
- The live route inventory reports 42 mutation registrations and 42 declared policies. Public ingestion is 11/11 against its explicit reviewed ceiling.
- Dependabot exemption requires exact bot identity plus ecosystem-specific file scope. The workflow loads its validator from the pull request base SHA with `persist-credentials: false`; substantive CI is not bypassed.
- Direct verification passed: 147 Vitest files / 873 tests, production coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, bundle budgets, 26/26 Playwright tests, 41 deploy-contract checks, and project doctor 11/11 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Cloudflare deploy/DNS and Brevo capabilities resolve READY, but both available Cloudflare tokens returned HTTP 403 for Email Routing rules. Delivery remains unverified rather than inferred.
- No external staging, native Obelisk relying-party, project-domain delivery, distinct-human Alpha, live-web/revenue/rollback, or founder approval was fabricated.

## 2026-07-23 — Session 81 certified-loop truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-23.json` is exhausted at 6/6 shipped with zero pending unblocked items.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is exhausted at 20/20; three consensus/risk/composition candidates were generated and implemented this session.
- Scheduled public free-for-all, team, special, and ranked configurations enable both VaultFront feature flags; private configuration remains explicit.
- Seasonal contract and loop-evidence writes derive from certified match outcomes. Browser mutation endpoints return 410 and cannot create authoritative progress.
- PostgreSQL stores enforce replay/idempotency; an unavailable configured database fails closed. Database-free development receipts say `process-local` rather than persistent.
- Prediction League uses authenticated actor identity, game/player uniqueness, a shared per-game advisory lock for submit/resolve, durable private stats, and aggregate consensus without exposing participant identity.
- Mutation inventory reports 42/42 routes classified and public ingestion 10/10. Worker reports 4,028 physical lines against a 4,040 ceiling; extracted route literals are forbidden from returning.
- Release evidence reports work exhausted and transfer budgets passing, but remains blocked because staging, runtime health, parity, email, identity, human, live-web, revenue, rollback, and founder observations are absent.
- Direct verification passed: 155 Vitest files / 904 tests, production-inclusive coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, bundle budgets, 26/26 Playwright, and 41 deploy checks.
- The local tree contains a valid but mislabeled preexisting Session 81 commit; no reset, amend, force-push, or fabricated provenance was used.
- A sibling Studio Ops release-gate file was changed by an accidentally invoked generator. VaultFront did not edit or revert the sibling; Ark owns the correction handoff.

## 2026-07-23 — Session 82 entitlement and balance truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-23.json` is cumulatively exhausted at 10/10 shipped; every new premise was rechecked against live code before implementation.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is evidence-derived and exhausted at 25/25; five new second-order candidates were generated and implemented this session.
- Protobufjs is exactly 7.6.5, the lock integrity is pinned, CI audits at moderate severity, and `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Season Pass state derives from certified player/game results. PostgreSQL owns replay keys, aggregates, and cosmetic entitlement claims; actor-bound routes reject cross-player reads/writes and configured persistence failure returns unavailable rather than falling back.
- Convoy reward defaults and formula have one executable authority. The public envelope is byte-stable, verifies 28,125 deterministic scenarios across six invariants with zero counterexamples, and its source/artifact digests participate in tamper-sensitive release lineage.
- Experiment summaries truthfully label assignment and aggregate storage as process-local with a worker-restart reset boundary. Worker is 3,108 physical lines against a 3,130 ceiling; five extracted domains are reclamation-checked.
- Release evidence reports work exhausted and transfer budgets passing. It remains blocked on eight absent external observations plus dirty source before commit; local success is not staging, human, email, identity, theme, or approval evidence.
- Direct verification passed: 160 Vitest files / 923 tests, 31.57% production-inclusive line coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, exact bundle/media budgets, 26/26 Playwright, 42/42 mutation policies, 10/10 public ingest, and zero npm vulnerabilities.

## 2026-07-24 — Session 83 progression and pressure truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-24.json` is exhausted at 4/4 shipped; six attractive premises were rejected against live code or absent external evidence.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is evidence-derived and exhausted at 28/28; three receipt/catalog/rules invariants were generated and implemented this session.
- Certified progression coalesces concurrent player/game attempts, releases failures for retry, serializes PostgreSQL writes with an advisory lock, and enforces one match-history row per player/game. Completion receipts carry a stable digest and tamper verification.
- Achievement progress reads authenticate the player, reject cross-player claims, and are isolated behind an injected router included in the Worker composition contract.
- State-scope readiness distinguishes store capability from effective runtime scope, fingerprints the capability catalog, and blocks contradictory owner/capability declarations instead of rendering plausible stale prose.
- Vault Pressure open/expiry/final-tick/victory transitions are pure and deterministic. The three-delivery threshold and 900-tick window come from the versioned balance authority consumed by runtime and the 28,125-scenario public envelope.
- Worker is 3,098 physical lines against 3,130; VaultFrontExecution is exactly 2,917 formatter-stable lines against its new composition ceiling; mutation policy is 42/42 and public ingest 10/10.
- Direct verification passed: 165 Vitest files / 935 tests, production-inclusive coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, exact bundle/media budgets, 26/26 Playwright desktop/mobile, and 41 deploy-contract checks.
- Release remains NO-GO. Credential readiness did not authorize provider mutation, and no staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder-approval evidence was inferred.
