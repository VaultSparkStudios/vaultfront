# Truth Audit

## 2026-09-30 — Session 113 renewed release audit

- Chronology truth: Session 112's product and staging work was already committed and pushed; Session 113 changed no game code or live artifact before this closeout.
- Live truth: readiness observed at 2026-10-01T01:50:50Z reports `releaseStatus: blocked` on contactEmail, obeliskIdentity, revenueObservation, founderApproval, and alphaHumanEvidence. Alpha status is `not-started`, distinct authenticated human sessions are zero, and the production apex returns HTTP 503.
- Capability truth: `zoho.mail.admin` and `obelisk.identity.verify` are still MISSING. No Zoho reply-as, authenticated relying-party journey, positive payment, human Alpha corpus, or portable exact-artifact approval is inferred from operational authorization.
- Deployment truth: the direct deploy request is recorded, but production was not mutated because canonical admission is red. Existing staging evidence is time-bounded and must be refreshed before later promotion if expired.
- Derived-state limit: the shared state-vector renderer shows `velocity: null` for this session's explicit zero and `openBlocked: 0` despite the task board's `[BLOCKER]` lines. The SIL and live release record retain the authoritative zero velocity and five release gates; the renderer discrepancy is not relabeled as green.

## 2026-09-30 — Session 112 staging recovery and release truth

- Work truth: audit items 249–252 are shipped. The database retry path is covered by simulated initial and later failure transitions, and the app-only restart observed public recovery through the untouched router after a brief boot-time 503. A real shared-host database outage was not induced.
- Provider truth: exact revision `8429bacc620effaaf98e00c217d2f472245b51e2` passed CI `36785710707` with 292 files / 1,523 assertions, E2E `36785710727`, staging dry-run `36786295782`, and current staging deploy `36793728506`.
- Visual truth: signed observer `36793985784` passed 27/27 live cells with zero findings, worst LCP 1,228 ms, INP 144 ms, CLS 0.0151. The local source-bound receipt covers 144 inspected artifacts across three themes and desktop/mobile.
- Rollback truth: the older tag-sourced attestation failed `run-source-ref-mismatch` before admission. Two distinct images of the same main-sourced repaired revision then passed validation `36793998771` and drill `36794269177`; current image `sha256:0d8ad109a33933c8db051b05c3f4b8100d552288136b02469bcd9e01c656be5e` was restored healthy in 33,702 ms. This proves image restoration, not rollback to different code.
- Release truth: exact canonical admission rejects contactEmail, obeliskIdentity, revenueObservation, founderApproval, and alphaHumanEvidence. Zoho and Obelisk verification capabilities are missing their required values, Stripe checkout is ready but no positive live receipt exists, and the genuine human gate is not started. Production remains HTTP 503 and was not mutated.
- Cross-repo truth: signed Ark cargo `01K3Q7CB30696610376E88F928` reported the incompatible 109-file propagation; no sibling source file was edited.

## 2026-08-25 — Session 110 startup and immutable-release truth

- Work truth: audit items 245–247 are shipped. The startup brief source manifest and `.cache/` tooling boundary are regression-tested; innovation remains honestly exhausted at 70/70.
- Provider truth: exact revision `85ac5ff7b78f3880d2eeaccceb3b961a67efa4a5` passed CI `32910564760`, E2E `32910564784`, Release `32910564773`, and staging `32911008849`.
- Observation truth: run `32911217105` passed nine live cells with zero findings; worst LCP 1,788 ms, INP 176 ms, and CLS 0.0066. Footer, theme, health, and cost-neutral evidence pass.
- Rollback truth: validation `32911479205` bound the S109 image to the S110 candidate; drill `32911552613` observed rollback and exact restoration. Staging reports the exact S110 SHA with 2/2 workers.
- Local-test truth: focused regressions and contracts pass. One broad local file retained an unrelated historical five-second timeout under host contention, so exact provider CI—not that local attempt—is aggregate authority.
- Release truth: production remains HTTP 503. Zoho reply identity, authenticated Obelisk, three human Alpha sessions, positive live revenue, portable exact-artifact approval, and canonical mobile-parity attestation remain red; a green dry-run is not production authorization.

## 2026-08-25 — Session 109 propagation and release-requalification truth

- Chronology truth: Session 108 had closed product work, but later Studio propagation replaced seven project-proven verification surfaces. Repair commit `03887080` restores those surfaces and preserves the incoming maintenance protocol; it is independently green in CI `32883787037` and E2E `32883787049`.
- Work truth: audit items 243–244 are shipped; innovation remains honestly exhausted at 70/70. No game mechanic or balance change was admitted without real human evidence.
- Staging truth: repaired staging `32886877642`, nine-cell observation `32887206185`, and promotion dry-run `32887551349` pass. A second observation `32889128703` recorded one 232 ms INP cell; the earlier success is not erased and the later outlier is not hidden.
- Rollback truth: non-main and stale-attestation attempts were rejected before mutation. Revision `1149d78b` passed CI `32890831350`, E2E `32890831315`, Release `32890831316`, and deploy `32891518865`, creating a fresh main-sourced known-good target for the post-closeout rollback drill.
- Release truth: production remains HTTP 503. Zoho reply identity, authenticated Obelisk, three genuine authenticated human Alpha sessions, positive live revenue, and portable exact-artifact founder approval remain red; thread-level operational authorization is not relabeled as a portable release claim.

## 2026-08-22 — Session 107 contact-transport recovery truth

- Chronology truth: ten substantive commits followed the Session 106 SIL anchor. Nine are the un-written-back contact-mail continuation; commit `8006d7b8` is a later canonical Studio OS asset synchronization. The clean tree and synchronized remote did not prove closeout currency.
- Transport truth: Brevo authenticated outbound delivery and Cloudflare inbound routing are independently evidenced. Cloudflare apply `31993840009` created the exact route, and the tagged probe was observed as `forward` and `delivered` with SPF/DKIM pass.
- Identity truth: no Zoho External From configuration or real human reply-as observation exists. Transport delivery is not human reply identity.
- Verification truth: both mail automation scripts pass syntax checks and project doctor passes 13/13 with `blockingFailing: 0`. The local aggregate passed 32 files / 231 assertions but eight workers timed out during startup; serial isolation remained process-starved, so a fresh full-suite green is not claimed.
- Release truth: authenticated Obelisk, three distinct authenticated humans, positive live revenue, portable founder approval, and project-domain reply identity remain red. Production remains unavailable.

## 2026-08-16 — Session 106 exact-admission and staging truth

- Work truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-16.json` records eight shipped local findings (225–232) and five independent externally observed gates (233–237); blocked evidence is not converted into code-shaped green.
- Verification truth: four bounded canonical shards pass 288 files / 1,501 assertions. TypeScript, lint, format, production build, 28,125 balance scenarios, 166 deploy checks, and project doctor pass.
- Pixel truth: 138 hash-bound captures cover three themes and desktop/mobile at source digest `sha256:62810b38c7403b097e4f9a25845fd9e29d0689e84bbb8b6363f469083cd31b2f`; the touched prediction states were directly inspected.
- Provider truth: exact revision `6398ff2abce57deced8ddd78e0b4e784514518a9` passed CI `31932241126`, E2E `31932241144`, Release `31932241143`, and staging deploy `31932526593` at image `sha256:6c0cd340a8f9ee464b09a1326826c55b0b7d8c897e610a89898a3891985fa937`.
- Observation truth: run `31932651393` admitted exact staging parity plus live theme/footer evidence. Rollback run `31932798320` observed rollback and restored the exact candidate healthy with 2/2 workers.
- Identity truth: unauthenticated Obelisk corridor smoke no longer mints a pass. No complete authenticated relying-party journey is observed.
- Release truth: exact release admission rejects contactEmail, obeliskIdentity, revenueObservation, founderApproval, and alphaHumanEvidence before mutation. Production remains HTTP 503.

## 2026-08-16 — Session 105 exact-live and recovery truth

- Chronology truth: nine substantive VaultFront commits followed the Session 104 SIL anchor and were already on synchronized `origin/main`; S105 ended after implementation/evidence capture but before canonical write-back.
- Work truth: audit item 224 is shipped. The landing shell and exact-live capture changed; the certified game-loop timing did not.
- Provider truth: implementation `a1c861b0` passed CI `31922598710`, E2E `31922598682`, Release `31922598764`, and staging deploy `31922760549` at immutable image `sha256:b4aefb23f84e5d4b6bf3245224a1f54bdef4e4ac9ac15bada4c339afe1b224d6`.
- Pixel truth: observation `31922854694` measured all nine cells with zero findings; worst LCP 1,424 ms, INP 152 ms, CLS 0.0066. It admitted a clean-checkout 138-capture theme receipt and the footer on all 11 public routes.
- Rollback truth: run `31923970973` rolled back and exactly restored the implementation image in 31,561 ms; the receipt is canonically verified and freshness-bounded.
- Verification truth: 21 focused files / 93 assertions, spawn regression, contracts, build, balance, format, and doctor 13/13 pass. A local aggregate attempt left orphan descendants after wrapper termination; those exact trees were stopped and the aggregate is not counted green.
- Release truth: production remains unavailable. Zoho reply identity, three authenticated humans, positive live revenue, and portable founder approval remain red; none is inferred from passing staging evidence.

## 2026-08-14 — Session 104 signed runtime and release-boundary truth

- Work truth: docs/AUDIT_2026-08-14.json records items 220–223 shipped; no remaining local code premise is conflated with external release observations.
- Verification truth: 282/282 files and 1,473/1,473 tests pass with coverage; type, lint, format, build, contracts, 28,125 balance scenarios, E2E 30/30, deploy contract 166 checks, and CANON-053 source validation are green.
- Evidence truth: runtime admits independently signed exact-current claims and rejects caller-authored status/digest trust. Public readiness directly showed verified staging, health, and Obelisk claims from run 31783247576.
- Revenue truth: the checkout route and signed webhook are real and durable; readiness requires a positive live payment receipt. No environment flag, route probe, fixture, or session creation is labeled revenue.
- Provider truth: 715a223d passed CI 31782855756, E2E 31782855605, and Release 31782855608; staging run 31783247576 deployed immutable image sha256:7b74f276479500fcecf168e297426b3380b08d27043019fe70e846d01fd585fc.
- Rollback truth: validation 31787165044 and drill 31787212414 observed known-good f78385cb and exact restoration to 715a223d in 30,140 ms; public health after restoration is 2/2.
- Parity truth: the exact-live capture exceeded its expected bound and emitted no report. Historical 0a9149c8 Core Web Vitals are not carried forward.
- Release truth: Zoho capability/DNS, three-human Alpha, real payment, and parity remain red; six production routes return 503. Production was correctly not promoted.

## 2026-08-14 — Session 103 game-loop, protocol, and release truth

- Work truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-13.json` is exhausted at 16/16 cumulative items with 214–219 shipped; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is exhausted at 70/70.
- Game truth: the executable Capture → Convoy → three Pressure deliveries → 90-second Breach → decisive fourth-delivery spine is documented. Human evidence is zero, so Loop Tightness is 90, Progression 82, Session Engagement 70, Retention Hooks 65, and Soul Fidelity remains unscored.
- Verification truth: canonical `npm test` passes 278 files / 1,454 tests. TypeScript, lint, formatting, production build, 28,125 balance scenarios, contracts, bundle budgets, project doctor 13/13, and focused Playwright theme proof 2/2 pass directly.
- Visual truth: 138 source- and artifact-hash-bound captures cover three themes across desktop/mobile at source digest `sha256:a916c97b37df96bc4a7bb7f83ab23b9d080df734b10faf02745dd2c5270dc401`; CANON-053 passes.
- Security truth: settings sanitization is clean; staged scan reports zero secret findings; generated `context/SIGNALS.md` and `portfolio/compiled/FORECAST_LEDGER.json` are ignored and absent.
- Agent-surface truth: `/agents.json` now declares the staging-observed Obelisk authorization-code/PKCE entrypoint; it does not claim production availability. Canonical runtime readiness still has no attached release-observation bundle, so workflow/docs receipts remain insufficient.
- Provider truth: exact implementation revision `78bbf1127424c7279a4f7a06a5922dfba06e35ad` passed CI `31772610008`, E2E `31772610001`, Release `31772609992`, and brief validation `31772609994`.
- Staging truth: run `31772833502` deployed immutable image `sha256:3f7f07ae4d232d682fea6976580e2bda6397944b7a73501e31afe71bdf78b9f7`; live commit identity is exact, worker health is 2/2, product smoke is `sha256:b5f6a640c9b257dfbeb4f8652d19390cf2cd18247f20b9dcefc4e228c85e5f4a`, and the run-bound attestation is `sha256:27722fdd4d91e52bccf9e54e2ad9e11b5ccc7786d709620efb6aeaf15ae5692e`.
- Release truth: production remains 503 / NO-GO. Live Alpha is 0/12 with zero human events, Zoho reply identity and revenue remain absent, and runtime canonical readiness has no attached observation bundle.

## 2026-08-13 — Session 102 exact-revision and production-boundary truth

- Work truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-13.json` records nine shipped findings and one deferred external-mail observation; the canonical contact source correction is not conflated with provider delivery proof.
- Verification truth: 274 files / 1,434 tests pass with coverage; Playwright passes 30/30; 132 desktop/mobile/theme captures are bound to source digest `sha256:eb0f3c4fc5b7d02794da0016db0ba0b11cbd886e4361b4d16f1b66466e97f524`.
- Provider truth: exact revision `f938652c76095920b87c51c11ccd7a37df959ddd` passed CI `31742793799`, E2E `31742793815`, DB migration `31742793818`, Release `31742793774`, and brief validation `31742793786`.
- Staging truth: run `31743202674` deployed image digest `sha256:19f0f9573b8f83f692d06ce61b237b78e5cf0104d577c0d3fec2892a29162242`; health is 2/2, commit identity is exact, agent endpoints respond, and the Obelisk login redirect has PKCE/state-cookie semantics.
- Promotion truth: validation run `31743525021` passed dry-run and retained its receipt. It did not switch production.
- Release truth: production returns 503. Founder authorization satisfies the approval gate but cannot satisfy Zoho reply identity, three-human usage, real revenue, observed rollback, or production parity/Core Web Vitals; production remains NO-GO.

## 2026-08-12 — Session 101 saturated-arc and staging truth

- Recovery boundary: Session 100's interrupted work was verified, committed as `eeb2a674`, pushed, and separately deployed before Session 101 began. No S100 uncommitted state was silently folded into the fresh arc.
- Work truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-12.json` is exhausted at 8/8 shipped and `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` at 70/70; work exhaustion reports zero pending unblocked items.
- Runtime truth: the master-owned API proxy closes the live SPA-fallthrough defect. Staging product smoke observes `/api/clans/leaderboard` as JSON with shard `0`, not merely a source-level route registration.
- Verification truth: canonical tests pass 268 files / 1,420 tests; Playwright 30/30; 126 visual artifacts across three themes and desktop/mobile; 133 deploy checks; project doctor 13/13 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Provider truth: exact revision `264f24e084251cef525f4215889bf16691b86162` passed CI `31641733457`, E2E `31641733438`, and Release `31641733412`. Earlier CI failures at `8c79d598` and `7f5801dc` are retained as real discovery evidence, not overwritten by reruns.
- Staging truth: run `31642400012` deployed immutable image digest `sha256:93066a1a85b01eb56a9c4f9d2e63e0e99569b287daf9b0efab9f22fb7cfd57a8`. Its attestation digest `sha256:b52078bacec25f3d46263ec8f0738e2369f51478a3001c68b9c60262712ae945` binds health, exact revision, and eight passed product checks.
- Release truth: production remains public-unlaunched / NO-GO. Healthy staging does not establish Zoho reply-as-alias delivery, three distinct authenticated humans, real revenue, observed rollback, production parity/Core Web Vitals, or founder approval.
- Closeout-board truth: the initial generated board was format-valid but stale because its renderer preferred the first `Where We Left Off` heading and lacked project staging URL metadata. The renderer now selects the newest typed matching session section, the status declares stable staging plus preview production origins, and a focused chronology regression plus the full 1,420-test suite pass.

## 2026-08-12 — Session 100 interrupted-arc recovery truth

- Chronology: Session 100 died mid-implement/deployment, not mid-closeout. Twenty-two substantive commits after the Session 99 SIL anchor were already on `origin/main`; the master-route repair and every S100 canonical write-back surface were merely uncommitted.
- Integrity: the full dirty diff contained no merge markers, no malformed changed/untracked JSON or NDJSON, no half-written configuration, and no confirmed command-output debris. The stale session lock was recovery state, not evidence of a running process.
- Verification: canonical `npm test` passes 260/260 files and 1,401/1,401 tests. Local Playwright passes 30/30; focused radial and theme recaptures pass 2/2 each; 114 hash-bound artifacts were directly inspected. Doctor is 13/13 with `blockingFailing: 0` and work exhaustion reports zero pending unblocked items.
- Finding truth: audit items 191–195 are shipped. Item 190 is `deferred`, not falsely complete: domain, Cloudflare/GitHub provisioning, and exact-digest staging are done, while the production release observations are not.
- Deployment truth: revision `01ba5e4f` is live and healthy at `staging.vaultfront.io` with master plus two workers and exact commit/digest evidence. The production promotion run was dry-run validation; `vaultfront.io` returns 503, so production remains NO-GO.
- Recovery defect truth: live staging returned SPA HTML for `/api/vaultfront/playtest-pulse/summary`. The uncommitted repair makes the master own that public route and has direct release-contract coverage; it is not claimed live until a successor exact-sha staging deployment proves JSON.
- Visual truth: direct image review found broken radial proof icons caused by nonexistent fixture paths. The fixture now uses real assets; the receipt tracks all new UI/identity owners, expects the actual `account-handoff` surface, and no longer carries stale Session 98/Claude attribution.

## 2026-08-11 — Session 99 post-closeout recovery truth

- Manual chronology corrected the generic write-back checker: VaultFront's actual last SIL commit is `92d99249`, so the only uncaptured substantive successor is `1105af17`; unrelated Studio Ops hashes emitted by the generic explanation are not VaultFront evidence.
- The missing behavior is narrow and directly observable: `scripts/check-client-composition.mjs` now includes `src/client/Api.ts` at 2,043/2,060 lines, and `context/TASK_BOARD.md` already marks the #188 follow-up done.
- Recovery updates the remaining public-safe state surfaces without reimplementing code, inventing a new SIL score, or changing the production release posture.
- Startup profiling currently disagrees on project type: the central Arc profiler reports `app`, while `context/PROJECT_STATUS.json`, the local skill overlay, and the shipped product identify VaultFront as a `game`. Session 100 applies the game/product lens plus the public release gate and preserves this mismatch as central registry drift rather than silently trusting one derived label.
- Verification truth: the composition contract is green. The host could not provide one trustworthy aggregate Vitest run: four-worker execution failed to start eight forks, those exact eight files passed 81/81 serially, and a later one-worker aggregate timed out only in an already-passing translation scan. A 30-minute remaining-shards batch was explicitly terminated and is not counted as a pass. Doctor is independently green at 13/13 and `blockingFailing: 0`; exact provider CI will decide aggregate release truth.

## 2026-08-08 — Session 99 infra fix: configurable Worker init timeout, diagnosed correctly this time

- Root-cause discipline truth: the first attempt to make `WorkerClient.ts`'s 20-second Web Worker init timeout configurable (via `vite.config.ts`'s custom `process.env.*` `define` block, matching this codebase's existing `DOMAIN`/`GAME_SERVICE_ORIGIN` pattern) was verified to NOT WORK -- direct HTTP inspection of the dev-server-served module showed the literal unsubstituted `process.env.WORKER_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS` expression, and the SAME test on the pre-existing, already-shipped `process.env.GAME_ENV` reference in `Main.ts` proved this `define` mechanism has never applied to `vite serve` (dev) mode in this project at all, only to `vite build`. This was root-fixed by switching to Vite's native `import.meta.env.VITE_*` mechanism (confirmed working in dev mode by direct inspection: the served module's `import.meta.env` object correctly contained the injected value) rather than accepting the first, silently-broken attempt.
- Diagnostic truth: after the working fix still failed the local e2e run identically, the investigation did not stop at "still failing" -- it directly measured the actual bottleneck. A cold `Worker.worker.ts` compile (Vite cache cleared, fresh server) took 0.4 seconds, ruling out compile speed as the cause of a 60-second-plus failure. The conclusion -- OS/chromium-level CPU contention from this session's own accumulated hours of parallel background work -- is a measured inference, not a guess, and is disclosed as exactly that: a genuine environment limitation of this specific long-running interactive session, not a defect in the code or the fix.
- Isolation truth: `VITE_WORKER_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS` is set only in `start:e2e-client`'s npm script. Production and staging builds never reference it, so their behavior is unchanged; this was verified by confirming the variable is absent from every other build/dev script in `package.json`.
- Verification truth: 5 new unit tests cover the resolver function's fallback behavior (unset/empty/non-numeric/non-positive/valid); full suite re-confirmed green at 255 files / 1,374 tests; typecheck, lint, Prettier ratchet, `verify:contracts`, a full production rebuild with bundle-budget re-check (headroom preserved, not just re-passing at the edge), and doctor (13/13, `blockingFailing: 0`) all pass directly. Fresh Playwright visual proof passes 2/2 and was directly reviewed.

## 2026-08-08 — Session 99 disclosed-gap closure: VaultFrontPlaytestPulse.ts coverage fixed

- Disclosure-to-closure truth: the `VaultFrontPlaytestPulse.ts` branch-coverage gap disclosed earlier this session (real, pre-existing, from already-committed Session 98 work; deliberately left as an honest disclosure rather than silently patched or masked at the time) is now genuinely fixed, not merely re-disclosed again. This closes the loop the earlier disclosure opened.
- Coverage truth: measured coverage rose from 91.57%/85.46%/85.71%/92.81% to 100%/100%/100%/95.15% (statements/branches/functions/lines), confirmed both in an isolated test-file run and in a fresh full-project coverage regeneration (161 files / 873 tests) -- the two measurements agree exactly (95.15% branches in both), ruling out a scoping artifact.
- Test truth: 13 new tests were added, each targeting a real, previously-unexercised code path identified from the actual v8 coverage-final.json branch/statement maps (not guessed): the 20,000-entry dedupe-window FIFO eviction, human-actor-missing rejection, human-actor-session-conflict rejection, tutorial-skip and rival-goal-saved counters, the "broad activity but zero rivalry exposure" operator-guidance branch (both the action-insights list and the operator-next object independently reach it), `buildVaultFrontPlaytestPulseSummaryFromEvents` and `isAllowedVaultFrontPulseEvent` (both entirely untested before this session), and 5 of the 6 certified-loop-stage "next thing to complete" guidance messages (the 6th, Pressure, was already covered by an existing test).
- Ratchet truth: `coverage-baseline.json`'s floor for this module was raised from 90.78/93.33/100/94.26 to 94/99/100/99 (branches/statements/functions/lines) -- a real safety margin below the newly measured 95.15/100/100/100, not the bare minimum needed to pass. `node scripts/check-coverage-ratchet.mjs` passes cleanly against the full-project measurement (global floor + 10 critical modules, zero failures).
- Verification truth: full suite re-confirmed green at 254 files / 1,369 tests; typecheck, lint, Prettier ratchet, and doctor (13/13, `blockingFailing: 0`) all pass directly. No client-rendering surface was touched by this fix, so no theme-proof recapture was needed.

## 2026-08-08 — Session 99 continuation audit: four new findings (186-189)

- Scope truth: a dedicated `/audit` pass was run against live code with an explicit exclusion list (nothing from items 167-185, the disclosed Follow-ups, or the just-shipped second-order pass) to avoid re-surfacing already-handled work. It reported several candidates investigated and dropped on pre-verification, including a false "no client composition ratchet exists" theory (refuted by finding `check-win-modal-composition.mjs` already exists) and a `/stats` CANON-047 theme-scope concern that turned out to already satisfy the documented floor.
- Prompt-injection truth: `RECAP_SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `COACH_DEBRIEF_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (`RemoteAiPrompts.ts`) both build their Anthropic user message from `context.record.info`, which includes `GameEndInfo.players[].username` -- the identical attacker-controllable field audit #173 already proved unsafe (hardened for XSS via `textContent`) and #174 already proved needed an explicit untrusted-data boundary for `DYNASTY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`'s clan-name field. Neither sibling prompt had that boundary. Both now do, and the same clause was added defensively to `PROPHECY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`/`ORACLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT`/`PREMATCH_BRIEF_SYSTEM_PROMPT` even though today's read confirms none of those three currently receive free-text usernames -- so a future input change to any of them cannot silently reopen this exact gap a third time. `tests/server/RemoteAiPrompts.test.ts` parameterizes the boundary-phrase assertion across all 6 prompts.
- Reward-loop truth: item #180 (shipped earlier this session) fixed the server half of the Fortune Deck reward -- a real production bug where draws were silently never persisted -- but a repo-wide grep confirmed zero client references to the resulting `fetchFortuneCollection`/`equipFortuneTitle` capability before this item. The reward a player won became invisible again the moment their win modal closed. `Api.ts` and a new `FortuneCollectionPanel.ts` (mirroring `AchievementsPanel`'s existing structure, mounted in `CommandCenter.ts`) now close that loop at L1+L2 scope; L3 (rendering the equipped title in `NameLayer.ts`/leaderboard) is intentionally deferred and disclosed in `TASK_BOARD.md` Follow-ups, not silently dropped.
- Composition-ratchet truth: `ControlPanel.ts` (3,537 lines) is the single largest file in the client codebase and was completely ungoverned by any line-budget contract, unlike `Worker.ts` and `WinModal.ts`. `scripts/check-client-composition.mjs` closes that gap for `ControlPanel.ts`, `GameRightSidebar.ts`, `RadialMenu.ts`, and `VaultFrontLayer.ts`. `Api.ts` is honestly excluded from this registry (it was under concurrent edit by the parallel Fortune Deck agent when the ratchet was written) and tracked as an open follow-up rather than measured against a stale or racy line count.
- Touch-target truth: `public/stats.css`'s `.theme-switcher button` was `min-height: 40px`, 4px under the project's own established 44px floor (`VaultFrontTutorial.ts`) -- the first public page to ship any tappable control, and the one that fell short of the in-game standard. Now 44px.
- Verification truth: typecheck, targeted tests (15/15 for items 186/188/189; 8/8 for #187's new API/panel tests), full lint, `verify:contracts`, and the full suite (254 files / 1,356 tests) all pass directly. Fresh Playwright theme-visual-proof passes 2/2 and was directly reviewed (the `chromium-vaultfront-play.png` and other artifacts) with no regression from any of the four items. Project doctor reaches `blockingFailing: 0` (13/13) only after the theme-proof receipt was regenerated to match the fresh capture -- not claimed stale-clean.
- Cumulative-ledger truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-08.json` now has 55/55 items shipped (51 from the main Session 99 arc + second-order pass, plus these 4).

## 2026-08-08 — Session 99 second-order addendum: three genuine follow-up gaps

- Investigation truth: rather than manufacturing filler second-order innovations to hit a quota, a dedicated read-only investigation was dispatched to check whether Session 99's own newly-shipped patterns (constant-time comparison, client crash telemetry, profanity filtering, viewport-mode extraction) had untreated siblings elsewhere in the codebase. It reported findings against concrete file:line evidence for four questions, verdicting "GENUINE GAP FOUND" for three and "NO GAP -- already covered" for the fourth (timing-safe comparison -- all eight admin-token sites plus the pre-existing `ReplayStore.ts`/`jwt.ts` comparisons were already constant-time or library-verified).
- Server-crash-telemetry truth: `Worker.ts`'s `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handlers previously only logged; `Master.ts` had no such handlers at all -- a master-process crash was fully unhandled before this session. Both now record into a new bounded (500-event), process-local `ServerCrashStore.ts`, registered in `StateScopeLedger.ts`, mirroring `ClientCrashStore.ts`'s shape exactly.
- Tournament-profanity truth: `POST /api/tournaments` accepted an unfiltered public-facing name while the sibling `POST /api/clans` two blocks above it in `Worker.ts` already gated name/description through the profanity matcher. `TournamentStore.create()` now takes the same injectable `isProfane` parameter.
- Viewport-mode truth: `GameLeftSidebar.ts` had a third byte-for-byte duplicate of the `viewportWidth()` method `ViewportMode.ts` was extracted from `ControlPanel.ts`/`GameRightSidebar.ts` to eliminate. It now imports the shared function.
- Budget truth: `WORKER_LINE_BUDGET` moved 2470 → 2490. A duplicated `truncateServerCrashMessage` helper was first extracted into `ServerCrashStore.ts` and shared between `Worker.ts`/`Master.ts` (shrink first); the ratchet covers only the genuinely new lines that remained.
- Verification truth: typecheck, targeted tests (14/14), full lint, and `verify:contracts` all pass directly; the full suite was re-run twice end-to-end and confirmed green at 250 files / 1,340 tests both times (one intervening "scripts" shard failure was the same pre-existing `InnovationPack.test.ts` collateral-disruption pattern already root-caused earlier in this session -- confirmed via isolation, not force-greened).
- Innovation-ledger truth: three new entries (`server-crash-telemetry-symmetry`, `tournament-name-profanity-gate`, `game-left-sidebar-viewport-mode-adoption`) appended to `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` with unique IDs and sequential ranks (63-65); the append-only `forgottenShippedInnovationIds` guard in `tests/scripts/InnovationPack.test.ts` still passes, confirming no prior entry was silently dropped.

## 2026-08-08 — Session 99 hardening, accessibility, and infra-race truth

- Work truth: audit items 171-185 are shipped; cumulative audit reaches 51/51 and innovations remain exhausted at 62/62 with zero pending unblocked local work.
- Security truth: WebSocket upgrades now share the same bounded payload cap as lobby/spectator connections; eight admin-token comparisons across `Worker.ts` route through one `timingSafeEqual`-based comparator (`AdminAuth.ts`), removing a timing-attack surface; player-name rendering uses `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` in `NameLayer.ts`; clan name/description creation is filtered through the existing profanity matcher, and the Dynasty AI system prompt now explicitly instructs the model to treat the clan field as an untrusted proper noun, never an instruction — closing an AI-prompt-injection surface via player-chosen clan names.
- Coverage/quality truth: `WorkerLobbyService.ts` test coverage rose from a measured 27.51%/29.41%/25%/38.04% (lines/statements/functions/branches) to 92.00%/92.20%/96.96%/81.52%, verified by direct `--coverage` measurement, not estimated; `coverage-baseline.json`'s floor for this module was raised to sit safely below the measured numbers, not to the measured numbers themselves.
- Infra-race truth: a suspected-flaky Vitest failure (`Failed to resolve import "src/..."`) was not accepted as unexplained flake. Reproducing it with `--maxWorkers=1` produced the identical failure set, disproving the initial concurrency hypothesis and pointing to a `vite-tsconfig-paths` async-initialization race instead; an explicit Vite alias fixed it deterministically, confirmed by re-running the affected shard clean twice in a row.
- Disclosure truth: `src/server/VaultFrontPlaytestPulse.ts` branch coverage (87.66%) sits below its `coverage-baseline.json` floor (90.78%) — a real regression introduced by already-committed Session 98 work, surfaced only now because this is the first fully clean coverage-ratchet run since then. This session did not touch that file; the gap is recorded in `context/TASK_BOARD.md` Follow-ups rather than silently patched, ignored, or used to lower the floor.
- e2e truth: `e2e/live-match.spec.ts` correctly traces the real production `vaultfront-match-ready` event through `ControlPanel.ts`/`FirstExtractionQuest.ts` and reliably reaches the `in-game` state (Solo click, modal, Compact Map, Start), but reproducibly times out (3/3 local runs, identical root cause each time) because `WorkerClient.ts:63`'s hardcoded 20-second Web Worker init budget does not reliably survive a cold local Vite dev-server compile of the 566KB `Worker.worker.ts` bundle on this machine. This is disclosed as a known local-verification limitation, not claimed as a passing test, and production gameplay-timeout code was not opportunistically changed to force a local pass.
- Bundle-budget truth: the initial-entry brotli/gzip baselines in `.bundlewatch.json` were ratcheted to the real post-session measured bytes (592,938 / 740,758) after a genuine size reduction (moving `ClientCrashReporter` behind a dynamic import) restored full 1% cross-platform variance headroom; the prior baseline was not silently widened to mask growth without cause.
- Verification truth: full canonical `npm test` passes 249 files / 1,333 tests across four bounded shards, confirmed clean twice after the infra-race fix landed. TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier ratchet, and `verify:contracts` (route policy, worker/router composition, execution composition, deploy contract, hosted-cron contract, balance authority, win-modal composition, OpenAPI drift) all pass directly. Multiple transient failures during this session's own heavy parallel verification workload (vitest worker-spawn timeouts, default-timeout flakes on unrelated pre-existing tests) were individually isolated and re-run before being classified as environmental rather than code regressions — none were force-greened without isolation evidence.
- Release truth: production remains NO-GO. No approved staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live theme, distinct-human Alpha, real revenue, observed rollback, exact-revision provider CI, or founder approval was inferred this session.

## 2026-08-08 — Session 98 recovery, deployment, stats, and admission truth

- Recovery truth: Session 98 (codex) was cut off mid-implement — not mid-closeout — after Session 97's genuine closeout (`8e264657`) had already committed and pushed. The prior session's implementation was verified against live code and a fresh full test/visual/doctor pass before any "done" claim, per the same discipline as prior interrupted-session recoveries.
- Work truth: audit items 167–170 are shipped; cumulative audit is exhausted at 36/36 and innovations remain exhausted at 62/62 with zero pending unblocked local work.
- Deployment truth: the remote updater's ingress model previously assumed host Traefik, which the live shared host does not run (it runs Caddy). It now uses one project-private Docker network and a stable nginx router bound only to the CANON-038-allocated loopback port; a candidate is health- and revision-admitted through that router before the incumbent is drained, and any activation/admission failure restores the exact prior route. No live deployment is claimed — this is a local/CI-verified contract change only.
- Public-surface truth: `/stats` and `/stats.json` are generated from one descriptor and are byte-identical; every metric explicitly states pre-launch unavailability with a reason rather than a fabricated zero, satisfying CANON-054 without inventing population or engagement data.
- Admission truth: release/Alpha Gate readiness now requires a fresh, ordered, server-certified Capture→Convoy→Pressure→Breach→decisive-delivery evidence chain in addition to the existing authenticated human-cohort checks; it cannot report ready from human activity alone.
- Verification truth: full canonical `npm test` passes 235 files / 1,233 tests across four bounded shards. One "scripts"-shard failure observed mid-recovery was classified flaky (CPU contention from concurrent diagnostic commands run by this recovery session, not a code regression) — confirmed by an isolated re-run and a second clean full-suite pass with no code changes between runs.
- Visual truth: fresh Playwright rendered-pixel proof passes 26/26 across chromium and mobile-chrome; 114 hash-bound artifacts cover three themes × desktop/mobile at source digest `sha256:dd00349c972434f1d77fe50184731877a51c019b4564aeaee26627d958137d64`, directly reviewed with no regressions from this session's changes.
- Debris truth: a stray `.playwright-cli/` directory of Playwright CLI console/page debug logs, left by the cut-off session and referenced nowhere in source, was deleted before closeout.
- Release truth: production remains NO-GO. No approved staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live theme, distinct-human Alpha, real revenue, observed rollback, exact-revision provider CI, or founder approval was inferred during recovery.

## 2026-08-06 — Session 97 persistence, intelligence, decision, and release truth

- Work truth: audit items 158–166 are shipped; cumulative audit 32/32 and innovations 62/62 are exhausted with zero pending unblocked local work.
- Persistence truth: certified archive completion requires durable admission; incomplete writes are explicitly receipted and queued for bounded retry. Achievement hydration and state-scope evidence consume the same authoritative store contracts.
- Deployment truth: a candidate is health- and revision-admitted before bounded incumbent drain. Traefik is the sole runtime ingress authority; the former topology blocker was a detector variable mismatch and its regression now exercises the real function-local label form.
- Security/AI truth: Turnstile capability logs retain no tokens. Remote provider work has one owned timeout, abort, cost, cache, outcome, and cleanup boundary; deterministic local coaching remains the immediate free baseline.
- Loop truth: coaching claims only certified causes; active non-power Doctrine identity reaches the next live generation; the reroute matrix is semantic, keyboard/touch accessible, and does not alter combat statistics.
- Visual truth: real-browser inspection found and fixed a Light-theme contrast defect. Playwright passes 2/2 across three themes and desktop/mobile; 114 artifacts are source/hash-bound and CANON-053 passes.
- Verification truth: all 232 files / 1,221 tests pass by exact evidence composition. GitHub coverage passed 1,218 unchanged tests and exposed three stale test-only ownership seams; the only changed file then passed 12/12 under V8 coverage, including all three repairs. Loaded-host worker-start/outer timeouts remain recorded as host admission failures, not assertion failures. Type, lint, format, contracts, balance, build, bundles, Bash syntax, and production audit pass.
- Release truth: release evidence has 12 genuine blockers before commit/provider execution. No approved staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live theme, distinct-human Alpha, real revenue, observed rollback, exact-revision CI, or founder approval is fabricated; production remains NO-GO.
- Deployment-execution truth: exact green SHA `5fbfc6ca` passed CI/E2E/Release, then staging dry-run `31162447355` failed before connection because all three deploy scripts were tracked as `100644`. Their Git modes are now `100755` and executable-mode regression is part of the deploy contract. The run also observed missing GitHub `DOMAIN`; public-safe local sources name `vaultsparkstudios.com`, but no live staging observation is claimed.
- Dependency truth: executable-mode SHA `a1f28f82` exposed newly published `GHSA-55q2-fjhq-7xh7`; the official advisory names DOMPurify 3.4.13 as first patched, its Cure53 tag is PGP-verified, and npm identity/integrity/license are coherent. Exact patched SHA `67f4811a` passes provider CI/E2E/Release/brief-format/Dependabot, production audit, build, lint, format, bundle, exact release evidence, and all 1,221 tests.
- Live-deployment truth: exact-SHA staging dry-run `31217165276` passes. Read-only host and DNS preflight found no VaultFront CANON-038 allocation, `STUDIO_PG_ADMIN_URL`, staging DNS, deploy user, or approved Caddy-to-Traefik transport; Caddy is active and Traefik absent. The workflow was not dispatched live because it would mutate the host and then fail ingress/durability admission. Signed Ark question `01JVF5O44A385AF9033E414452` owns reconciliation; production remains NO-GO.
- Second live-advisory truth: exact security head `6920b1b4` passes CI `31226843311`, E2E `31226843279`, Release `31226843269`, brief-format `31226843270`, and Dependabot `31226914767`, including build, lint, format, bundle, production audit, exact release evidence, and all 1,221 tests. Trust-approved Nano ID 3.3.18 is signed by the established maintainer and completes the async native zero-size fix missing from 3.3.17; focused ID tests pass 10/10, the supply-chain scan is zero, Playwright passes 2/2, and the source-bound visual receipt passes. The successor closeout commit is evidence-only and intentionally uses `[skip ci]`.

## 2026-08-05 — Session 96 lifecycle, reflection, and rematch truth

- Work truth: audit 23/23 and innovations 62/62 are shipped; the executable exhaustion checker reports zero pending unblocked local work.
- Lifecycle truth: leaving invalidates in-flight construction and stops pre-start or active runners exactly once. Worker, transport, canvas/RAF, layers, input, touch, timers, window listeners, and match-scoped EventBus callbacks have explicit owners.
- Collision truth: multi-tab detection observes only a same-origin browser storage lock. The UI makes no IP, fingerprint, recording, report, or suspension claim and produces no server anti-cheat evidence.
- Feedback truth: match/map ratings remain certificate- and actor-bound; one optional enumerated cause is retained for 30 days and exposed only in privacy-safe aggregate cohorts. No free text or human-outcome claim is introduced.
- AI/cost truth: the unauthenticated browser-authored micro-hint route is retired. Deterministic local tactical coaching remains immediate; certified recap/debrief/narration authority is unchanged.
- Progression truth: debrief polling and Doctrine identity are game-generation-bound. Stale receipts cannot overwrite a rematch, and Doctrine remains coaching/identity-only with no combat-power effect.
- Recovery truth: account magic-link validation, pending, success, and failure remain inside the themed accessible surface; duplicate activation is guarded and no blocking alert is used.
- Visual truth: Playwright passes 2/2 and the final 114-artifact three-theme desktop/mobile receipt passes CANON-053 at source digest sha256:b6f542a7ce41c529836c5d315fd89aa28ec86c8fc350a5e8c82bbc2fc55f0238. The local bitmap-view helper failed on the Windows sandbox credential API, so direct manual image-view inspection is not claimed.
- Verification truth: npm test passes 229 files / 1,198 tests; TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, contracts, 28,125 balance scenarios, production build, and work exhaustion pass directly.
- Provider truth: exact code-and-board revision `b45442ca` passed CI `31053545824`, E2E `31053548119`, and Release `31053545757`.`r`n- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO. Exact-revision provider success cannot substitute for staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live web/theme, three-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder approval.

## 2026-08-05 — Session 95 tooling, admission, asset, and rendered-text truth

- Work truth: audit items 145–150 are shipped; the cumulative audit is exhausted at 16/16 and innovations at 62/62 with zero pending unblocked local work.
- Tooling truth: the exact project-root skill-profile and sample-codebase commands execute through a deny-by-default allowlisted control-plane bridge with correct project and cwd semantics.
- Security truth: the full tree has zero secret findings after context-limited low-entropy suppression; synthetic GitHub and Stripe credentials remain high-confidence findings even inside asset paths. The unused internal Obelisk broker copy is absent and deployable-code boundary tests forbid its private policy and receipt paths.
- Admission truth: users/@me introspection has an owned five-second deadline, abort signal, normalized errors, and timer cleanup; issuer and audience verification are unchanged.
- Asset truth: resources have one explicit static-copy owner, stable root imports resolve virtually, production transforms 2,201 modules and copies 47 targets with zero retired warnings, and source and built English catalogs match.
- Visual truth: image-capable review found corrupted Settings punctuation; the transport-safe fix is guarded at the asset and exact rendered DOM layers. Playwright passes 2/2 and the final 96-artifact receipt passes Canon 053.
- Verification truth: canonical `npm test` passes 224/224 files and 1,189/1,189 tests through four disjoint fail-fast shards; the prior exact coverage receipt remains 35.59% lines, and contracts, balance, Pages, bundle, sanitization, secret scan, and doctor 13/13 pass.
- Provider truth: the first exact-revision test job passed all tests and contracts but failed the immutable Doctrine coverage floor. Added durable snapshot, duplicate transaction, auth, and error-mapping coverage raised the store to 70.32% lines and retained Router 100%. The recovered code-and-board head `ae6809a5` passed exact CI `30977090883`, E2E `30977090884`, and Release `30977090890`; two dependency-review jobs on the same revision also passed.
- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO on external evidence; green provider workflows do not substitute for staging/parity, email/identity, live web, human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder approval.

## 2026-08-04 — Session 94 recovery, personal-agency, Doctrine, and compact-health truth

- Recovery truth: provenance classified the stale lock and 48-file tree as cut off mid-implement; JSON parsed, no NDJSON or merge corruption existed, and origin/main matched HEAD before recovery edits. One focused red disproved the prior done claim until its canonical event authority was repaired.
- Work truth: the latest audit is exhausted at 10/10; innovations are monotonic and exhausted at 62/62; zero pending unblocked local work remains.
- Agency truth: First Extraction personal steps require exact actor activity/status evidence. Team Pressure/Breach is separately labeled context and cannot retroactively award personal capture, convoy, contribution, or decisive delivery.
- Doctrine truth: three versioned Doctrines are coaching/identity-only. Authenticated selection is rate-limited, replay-safe, transactional under PostgreSQL, parity-preserving in process-local mode, insufficient-funds fail-closed, and receipt-digested.
- Startup/doctor truth: genius hit lists render actionable work only and represent exhausted/blocked/unknown taxonomy explicitly. PROJECT_STATUS carries compact doctor aggregates bound to audits/doctor-latest.json; non-green detail is lazily loaded and digest-verified.
- Visual truth: 96 source- and artifact-hash-bound captures cover sixteen states across three themes × desktop/mobile. Six new agency/doctrine captures were directly inspected after Playwright 2/2; CANON-053 passes with no blocking contrast, overflow, clipping, or stacking defect.
- Verification truth: four direct Vitest shards pass 218/218 files and 1,165/1,165 tests; mutation coverage is 30/30 with public ingest 4/4; work exhaustion and doctor blockingFailing 0 pass.
- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO. Local recovery and visual proof do not establish approved staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live web/theme, three-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, exact-revision provider CI, or founder approval.

## 2026-08-04 — Session 93 reachability, narration, recovery, and rendered-pixel truth

- Work truth: `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-04.json` is exhausted at 5/5; all four Session 93 second-order innovations are shipped; the cumulative innovation ledger remains monotonic at 59/59; zero pending unblocked local work remains.
- Reachability truth: eight admitted runtime capabilities have a machine-checked server/transport/mounted-consumer chain. Fourteen retired routes carry explicit tombstones; their handler literals and deleted implementation modules cannot silently return.
- Narration truth: only accepted GameServer events enter the certified privacy-minimal projection. A deterministic local line is always available; remote artificial-intelligence enrichment is optional and cannot replace or delay the baseline. Public browser-authored narrator event ingestion is absent.
- Prematch truth: one presentation generation owns its requests, abort signal, six-second deadline, cleanup, and result admission. Loading, degraded, and ready are distinct accessible states; a stale or hidden session cannot mutate the current modal.
- Recovery truth: reconnect lifecycle states are visible and accessible; bounded FIFO overflow is explicit. Transport `open` occurs once only after rejoin synchronization and queued-intent flush reach zero.
- Public-route truth: the app footer and generated public mirror project one canonical shared graph. The checker verifies equality, digest stability, consumer ownership, and absence of hard-coded route copies.
- Visual truth: 90 source- and artifact-hash-bound captures cover fifteen touched states across three themes × desktop/mobile. The initial captures revealed foreground below backdrop despite DOM assertions; final proof requires numeric `foregroundZ > backdropZ` and directly inspected captures show the repaired surfaces.
- Verification truth: 214/214 Vitest files and 1,147/1,147 tests; TypeScript; warning-free lint; contracts; mutation policy 29/29 with public ingest 4/4; runtime reachability; balance 28,125/28,125; production compilation and Vite bundle; final rendered-pixel Playwright; CANON-053; exhaustion; and doctor with `blockingFailing: 0` pass directly.
- Release truth: the build's final release-evidence gate correctly returns NO-GO because the source is not yet committed/exact-revision provider-tested and external staging/parity, Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live-web, three-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, and founder observations are absent. Nothing was fabricated to turn that boundary green.

## 2026-08-03 — Session 92 release-admission, runtime-recovery, and rendered-state truth

- Capability truth: project discovery layers the canonical Studio capability map under deterministic local overrides, fails loudly on corrupt authority, and reports the full catalog without exposing secret values.
- Release-gate truth: runtime readiness and generated release evidence consume one packaged semantic catalog and fingerprint; synthetic generic observations cannot satisfy the human Alpha gate.
- Staging truth: production promotion derives image/revision/origin from a fresh successful same-repository `deploy.yml` run and retained hash-bound attestation; caller-authored image and staging digests are absent.
- Recovery truth: a live promotion requires an exact successful dry-run receipt. Rollback separately admits the replaced and restored staging attestations, then retains a self-verified production health/revision outcome for 90 days.
- Persistence truth: non-development deployment requires `DATABASE_URL`, applies the idempotent schema before traffic, and exposes database posture through worker/master health rather than claiming durability from configuration alone.
- Delivery truth: CI builds and hashes one complete artifact for downstream consumers, and upload explicitly retains hidden `.well-known` files so the downloaded path universe equals the manifest; Actions, official image manifests, and SSH host evidence are immutable and provenance-checked. GitHub release planning is repository-owned, deterministic, serialized, and side-effect gated; it no longer loads Semantic Release or bundled npm.
- Runtime truth: transport recovery is FIFO, reject-newest bounded, generation-safe, synchronization-gated, and explicit about retry state. Telemetry service/version/revision/environment derive from VaultFront source identity and bounded idempotent shutdown.
- Product truth: execution-chain timing/reward come from the active balance authority; accessibility and reduced motion are first-class. Unreachable server tutorial routes/state were deleted and cannot reappear without a mounted-consumer contract.
- Visual truth: 36 current hash-bound captures cover three themes, two viewports, and six surfaces/states. Browser assertions cover contrast, overflow, scroll, source parity, accessibility, and reduced motion; refreshed Light completion pixels were directly inspected through a local JPEG fallback.
- Verification truth: clean `npm ci`; 210/210 Vitest files and 1,141/1,141 tests; type, lint, format, contracts, balance, production build, Pages, exact transfer/media budgets, full production+development dependency audit at zero, supply-chain scan, Playwright 26/26, CANON-053, audit 10/10, innovations 59/59, exhaustion, and doctor pass directly. Exact-revision provider CI `30878311700` passed every job, including exact artifact verification and release evidence; E2E `30878311715` and the dependency-free GitHub Release planner `30878311702` also passed.
- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO. Approved staging/parity, project-domain Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live-web evidence, three distinct authenticated humans, real revenue, observed rollback, and founder approval are absent and were not inferred.

## 2026-08-02 — Session 91 certified feedback, topology, and observation truth

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-02.json` is exhausted at 6/6; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is monotonic and exhausted at 53/53 with zero pending unblocked local work.
- Runtime ingress truth is singular: Traefik reaches Supervisor-managed nginx and Node; Docker no longer embeds cloudflared, tunnel credentials, or DNS mutation.
- Rollback truth requires a completed drill, restored health, and exact image digest. Revenue truth requires a live checkout/supporter source and a positive amount. Their semantic projections are digest-bound and tamper-sensitive.
- Certified feedback is reachable only from post-match, separates match and map ratings, rejects stale-session overwrites, and visibly reports accepted, duplicate, rejected, or unavailable durability scope.
- Continuation chooses one action from ranked, rivalry, saved-goal, and alive-state evidence. The descriptive card is lazy-loaded; Season Pass progress is a real bounded SVG arc.
- Visual truth covers play, settings, and post-match across three themes × desktop/mobile. Eighteen artifacts bind exact source and artifact hashes and execute viewport, overflow, submit-reachability, and 44-pixel target checks. The unavailable bitmap viewer is recorded as degraded rather than silently claimed.
- Direct verification passed: 198 Vitest files / 1,088 tests, TypeScript, ESLint, formatting, 50 deploy checks, 28,125 balance scenarios, production build, Pages, bundle/media budgets, zero production vulnerabilities, supply-chain scan zero matches, and Playwright 26/26.
- Release remains public-unlaunched / NO-GO. Dirty source clears on commit; no approved staging/parity, verified Zoho reply identity, native Obelisk, live web/theme, distinct-human Alpha, real revenue, observed rollback, or founder approval is inferred.

## 2026-08-02 — Session 90

- Work truth: the latest audit is 10/10 shipped and the monotonic innovation ledger is 50/50 shipped; the executable exhaustion checker reports zero pending unblocked items.
- Causal game truth: authenticated one-vote elections durably select effective-week mutators; competitive sides own Pressure; actor contribution and certified actor/game dividends remain attributable and tamper-evident.
- Visual truth: six theme/viewport cells produce twelve checked-in artifacts bound to exact UI sources and summary hashes. Direct image inspection found and fixed onboarding occlusion, palette non-propagation, light-theme readability, and mobile drawer transition/ARIA drift.
- Build truth: TypeScript, lint, formatting, contracts, 28,125 balance scenarios, production build, Pages 10/10 plus worker 1/1, bundle/media budgets, performance, and production audit zero pass directly.
- Test truth: Vitest passes 194/194 files and 1,069/1,069 tests; Playwright passes 26/26 plus the final focused theme matrix.
- Release truth: local release evidence is blocked on absent external observations and dirty source before commit. Exact-revision CI evidence can only be issued by the final fan-in job after all six parents pass.
- Cost truth: no paid dependency or variable-cost path was added; Max-plan cost remains notional.
- Launch truth: no staging, delivery, native identity, human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder approval was fabricated.

Overall status: local green; external launch NO-GO.

## 2026-07-19 — Session 75

- Audit truth: all 14 newly verified findings are shipped; the cumulative JSON sidecar is 37/37 shipped and Markdown is derived from it. The regenerated innovation pack is 6/6 with three new candidates implemented after primary exhaustion.
- Test truth: direct `npm test` passes 134 main files / 814 tests and independently repeats 31 server files / 119 tests. Playwright passes 24/24 desktop/mobile tests, including lazy Command Center loading and mobile drawer accessibility.
- Build truth: lint and TypeScript pass. Production build passes after Command Center was split into an 11.23 kB on-demand chunk; exact initial gzip is 740,285 bytes and Brotli is 588,036 bytes, both below enforced variance limits. Formatting and media/per-chunk budgets pass.
- Match truth: progression, archive, metrics, and certified post-match AI derive from one strict unique-IP-majority result certificate. No client projection substitutes for the certificate.
- AI truth: oracle inputs come from server-owned rating history; post-match inputs come from archived certified records. Provider output is schema-validated, deadline-bounded, cache-bounded, and receipt-digested with exact model identity.
- Release truth: the generated artifact is blocked, not ready. Eight canonical gates require fresh source/digest provenance; local footer/health/transfer/work gates pass, while staging, parity, Brevo, Obelisk, live themes, human Alpha evidence, and founder approval remain absent. The working-tree blocker is expected until the closeout commit.
- Agent truth: six capabilities are reachable in checked-in source and published as `implemented-local-unlaunched`; `public/agents.json` still declares `publicRuntime: unavailable` and advertises no executable live agent interactions.
- Doctor truth: direct process exit is 0 with 7/7 probes passing, no warnings, and `blockingFailing: 0`. Work exhaustion is audit 37/37 and innovation 6/6.
- Cost truth: remote AI remains optional/default-off and bounded under the notional flat-rate plan posture; no spend alarm or fabricated cost event was introduced.
- Launch truth: no staging deployment, human session, email delivery, relying-party auth, live web/theme evidence, revenue event, or founder approval is claimed.

## 2026-07-16 — Session 74

- Work truth: the latest audit sidecar contains 23/23 shipped entries, including 11 newly implemented findings; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` contains 3/3 shipped innovations. `check-work-exhaustion.mjs` returns `ok: true` with no pending unblocked IDs.
- Authority truth: all inventoried state-changing HTTP routes cross the shared verified-actor policy; contract tests cover the route inventory and actor/role decisions. This does not claim native Obelisk relying-party integration.
- Experiment truth: assignment is server-owned; accepted values are literal unit events with UUID identity and deduplication; invalid/duplicate/spoofed attempts are counted separately.
- Health truth: readiness is process-local and derives from HTTP, IPC freshness, and game-loop freshness. WebSocket payload, IP, spectator, worker, and buffered-byte limits are explicit policy values.
- Remote-AI truth: reservations are placed only after authentication, validation, and cache lookup, immediately before provider-bound work. Posture explicitly says `process-local-per-worker`; counters are not a global distributed quota.
- Build truth: TypeScript and warning-free Vite production build pass. The checked-in Windows baseline is 738,885 gzip bytes and 586,751 Brotli bytes; the gate permits an explicit 1% cross-platform compression envelope because zlib output differs slightly on Linux while preserving the exact baseline. Windows actual transfer is 738,884 gzip / 586,665 Brotli bytes; media aggregate and largest-artifact budgets pass. The Release Evidence Manifest reports both baseline/envelope and audit/innovation exhaustion.
- Test truth: the broad run passes 122 files / 762 unique tests; the server subset independently repeats 25 files / 90 tests; Playwright passes 22/22 desktop/mobile tests with two bounded local workers.
- Tooling truth: project doctor runs four real checks with `blockingFailing: 0`; formatting ratchet and lint pass after touched-file correction; sitemap compliance is 10/10 and Canon conformance reports zero gaps/zero absolute gaps.
- Security truth: settings sanitization found zero issues. The full-tree entropy scanner reports low-confidence false positives in inherited binary/base64 assets, so it is not claimed green; the authoritative staged-diff scan passed with zero findings.
- Release truth: public launch remains NO-GO. Studio Ops `release-gate` currently throws because registry `testing` is not an array, web hardening sees zero public origins, and the central cost gate still calls this project `exempt-internal`; signed Ark cargo requests control-plane correction. No sibling repo was edited.
- SIL truth: 968/1000 is the exact sum of 10 categories. Engagement and ecosystem scores remain bounded by absent real-human and external integration evidence.

## 2026-07-16 — Session 73

- Audit truth: all 12 items in `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-16.json` are marked shipped with per-item execution evidence; the Markdown audit is derived from that JSON. All 3 second-order innovation candidates are evidence-detected complete.
- Test truth: the final coverage run passed 107/107 files and 697/697 tests. The exact single-worker CI Playwright profile passed 22/22 desktop/mobile tests. A faster six-worker local stress run had two cold-start timeouts; both passed immediately in isolation and the canonical CI profile passed without retry.
- Build truth: TypeScript and Vite 7 production build pass. Every emitted JavaScript chunk is below 500 kB gzip under the dependency-free bundle gate. Remaining warnings are explicit: public URL placeholders are unset before deployment, two JSON import-attribute inconsistencies remain, and the manual chunk layout reports one circular-chunk warning.
- Security truth: authenticated/deduplicated source-labeled Alpha Gate evidence, fail-closed signed replay consumption, and authenticated sanitized rematch creation are covered. `npm audit` reports zero vulnerabilities after exact trust-gated updates; Studio supply-chain scan reports zero matching incidents.
- Cost truth: remote AI is default-off and requires an explicit positive hourly cap with feature attribution. Deterministic coaching remains the cost-neutral baseline.
- Public truth: local sitemap compliance is 10/10 and public/AI-agent/legal/contact surfaces exist, but this does not prove live hosting, email delivery, headers, Core Web Vitals, or theme readability.
- Canon/doctor truth: conformance reports 49 applicable Canon, zero gaps, and zero absolute gaps. Studio doctor reports `overallPass: true`, 112 passing, 33 advisory warnings, zero failing, and `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Profile truth: local status is `game/public-unlaunched`; signed Ark cargo `01JTM66B6TEE83C483CEB936FA` requests the registry type correction from `app` to `game`. No direct sibling-repo edit was made.
- Launch truth: no human Alpha Gate, staging parity, project-domain Brevo delivery, native Obelisk relying-party auth, live CSP/HSTS/Core Web Vitals/theme screenshot evidence, revenue event, or founder approval is claimed.
- SIL truth: score is recalibrated from an unsupported 999 to evidence-based 943/1000. The decrease is an honesty correction, not a product regression.

## 2026-07-16

- Recovery provenance: the immediate prior run stopped during `/start`; the inherited dirty layer matched a June 18 `lint-staged` recovery stash plus later Studio protocol propagation. No new audit or implementation had begun.
- Integrity truth: changed/untracked JSON parses; 53 changed/untracked scripts pass `node --check`; the Studio Claude-config guard reports valid configuration and zero corruption events in the prior 24 hours.
- Obelisk truth: the committed React `.tsx` helper was unreferenced and incompatible with this Lit project, failing TypeScript because React/JSX are not configured. All deployable Obelisk stubs were removed; `obelisk-passport/` remains local and ignored after being untracked.
- Verification truth: direct `npm test` passes 94 main files / 655 tests plus 10 server files / 30 tests. Studio doctor reports `overallPass: true`, 115 passing, 25 advisory warnings, 2 expected skips, and `blockingFailing: 0`. The local staging build initially failed on the React stub, proving the earlier build claim stale; the repaired local staging gate now passes `npm run build-prod` with TypeScript clean.
- Commit-gate truth: the recovery pre-commit hook initially reproduced three inherited lint failures; Obelisk TTL fallback, ANSI stripping, and CommonJS script lint configuration were fixed at source with focused ESLint green and no hook bypass.
- Sanitization truth: `docs/RIGHTS_PROVENANCE.md` is preserved locally but untracked/ignored; the root AGPL-3.0 `LICENSE` remains public and the upstream copyleft obligation is unchanged.
- Residual truth: live rivalry/rematch playtest evidence, observed revenue, production Obelisk relying-party registration, and route/server verification remain unclaimed.

## 2026-06-14

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14_S71.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped protocol helper guard changes and mark all 3 items shipped.
- Studio protocol truth: `tests/scripts/StudioProtocolHelpers.test.ts` covers stale startup brief rejection, per-tile budget attribution/trimming, and secrets-gateway capability readiness.
- PROJECT_STATUS invariant truth: `scripts/lib/write-project-status.mjs --check` passes after restoring the shared SIL v3 category list in `scripts/lib/sil-categories.mjs`.
- Obelisk truth: generated `obelisk-passport/` stubs remain local/ignored until production relying-party origin registration and deliberate auth wiring.
- Broad test evidence is now 94 main test files / 655 tests plus 10 server test files / 30 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 3 items shipped.
- Alpha Gate runbook truth: `VaultFrontAlphaGateRunbook` turns pulse/readiness payloads into checklist, success criteria, evidence fields, and warnings without clearing revenue evidence.
- Readiness truth: playtest-pulse evidence now includes the alpha gate pass label in warning and pass branches.
- Studio protocol truth: `generate-genius-list.mjs --json` has focused regression coverage for done-item semantics and human-blocked live-evidence gates.
- Broad test evidence is now 93 main test files / 652 tests plus 10 server test files / 30 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-13

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-13_S69.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark the 2 product items plus truth sync shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary payloads now include `alphaGate` with freshness, tutorial, feedback, Rival exposure, and Rival action checks.
- Readiness truth: a ready pulse score now remains warning-level unless the attached alpha gate is also ready.
- KPI tile truth: the Playtest Pulse tile now renders Alpha Gate status and the next missing check.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 647 tests plus 9 server test files / 27 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-07

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-07_S68.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark the 2 product items shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary payloads now include `operatorNext` with headline, steps, and successMetric derived from the same pulse counters used by readiness.
- KPI tile truth: the Playtest Pulse tile now renders Rival Challenge action conversion, latest signal age, and `operatorNext.headline`.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 645 tests plus 9 server test files / 25 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and Node tooling deprecation.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.
- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-07_S67.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Playtest pulse truth: summary totals/rates now include tutorial advancement, match feedback, and Rival Challenge retention conversion counters.
- Readiness truth: playtest-pulse evidence includes the first action insight, so launch-gate warnings name the next playtest action.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 643 tests plus 9 server test files / 24 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, and large chunks.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`; the helper validation command hit an intermittent Windows sandbox `CryptUnprotectData` error during closeout, so this invariant was verified from the JSON fields directly.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-05

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-05_S66.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Startup helper-chain truth: `node scripts/compact-handoff.mjs` and `node scripts/render-startup-brief.mjs` now pass after restoring missing helper modules.
- Broad test evidence is now 91 main test files / 640 tests plus 9 server test files / 23 tests.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; known non-blocking warnings remain for public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, and large chunks.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` is 998 and matches the sum of `silCategoriesV3`.
- `.ops-cache/` is ignored with `.cache/` so generated handoff cache does not create false dirty-worktree signals.
- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-05_S65.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes and mark all 4 items shipped.
- Fresh Codex closeout verification passed: blocker script syntax checks, blocker-preflight rendering, readiness focused Vitest (4 tests), production build, and broad `npm test`.
- Broad test evidence is now 90 main test files / 638 tests plus 9 server test files / 23 tests.
- Generated `.cache/` and `ignis/output/` artifacts are ignored so they do not create false dirty-worktree signals during session protocol runs.
- Known non-blocking warnings remain: Vite public URL placeholders, mixed JSON import attributes, large chunks, and expected test stderr paths.
- Revenue signal remains unverified until live checkout/supporter telemetry is observed.

## 2026-06-04

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-04_S64.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes.
- All 90 Vitest test files (637 tests) pass — broad `npm test` is now fully green. Previous 3 pre-existing failures (VaultFrontExecution mock staleness, VaultFrontLifecycle BigInt, CoachHintEngine trigger field) are repaired.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run build-prod` green (Vite bundled in 13.4s); touched-file ESLint clean.
- Entropy: 0.08 (healthy, computed and written to PROJECT_STATUS.json).
- Session 65 truth sync: `PROJECT_STATUS.silScore` now matches the latest public-safe Session 65 estimate (997), and test evidence now says 638 tests instead of stale 634/637.
- Revenue signal remains unverified. The readiness/startup code can now clear the warning only when explicit observed/verified evidence is supplied; it must not clear on `unverified`.
- Truth status upgraded from amber-green to green — all major verification surfaces are now clean.

## 2026-06-03

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-03_S63.md` and JSON sidecar match shipped code/test changes.
- `npm run build-prod` passes; CI-style serial `npm run e2e` passes with one flaky retry.
- Focused pulse/readiness/tournament tests pass; `tsc --noEmit` and touched-file ESLint pass.
- Broad `npm test` is not green due 3 residual non-touched failures in `VaultFrontExecution` and `CoachHintEngine`; project status should not claim full unit surface green until repaired.

## 2026-05-18

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-05-18.md` matches shipped code/test changes.
- Startup brief regenerated successfully after helper repair.
- Full lint/build are not green yet due unrelated pre-existing blockers; focused modified-file checks passed.

## 2026-07-20 — Session 76 truth audit

- docs/AUDIT_2026-07-20.json is the latest audit source: 5 total, 5 shipped, 0 pending.
- docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json is evidence-derived and reports 9 total, 9 shipped, 0 pending.
- Startup context usage is derived from tokens/limit; the live brief prints approximately 3%, not the former contradictory 80%.
- SIL history parses five current sessions and produces a nonzero evidence-backed forecast; the validator rejects a 0/1000 numeric claim.
- context/PROJECT_STATUS.json and context/STUDIO_MANIFEST.json agree on game / alpha / public-unlaunched. Their identity, public metadata, footer topology, and immutable deploy sources are represented by static/release-evidence.json projectTruth.fingerprint.
- Footer truth is scoped and non-vacuous: 10 pages, 4 header destinations, 7 footer destinations, with every header/footer-only/legal route present in each leaf footer.
- Deployment truth is staging-only plus explicit digest promotion; scripts/check-deploy-contract.mjs passes 25 checks including rollback receipt requirements.
- Release evidence is exhausted and transfer-budget green but remains blocked on absent staging/parity, Brevo, Obelisk, live theme, founder approval, and distinct-human Alpha evidence. Dirty source remains a blocker until the closeout commit.
- Verification observed directly: 134 Vitest files / 822 tests, independent 31-file / 121-test server repeat, lint green, production build green, Playwright 24/24, and project doctor 7/7 with blockingFailing: 0.
- Signed Ark cargos 01JU1AEATS46E1C7F5DD9AE41C and 01JU1AF6P1EF704DF81B654BAB carry the canonical correction request and reusable pattern. No sibling implementation tree was edited.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 77 recovery truth audit

- `classify-recovery-provenance.mjs` reports no corruption, unresolved merge markers, or lint-staged backup ambiguity.
- Session 76's product/runtime closeout is committed at `22c2b3a6`; Session 77 contained only uncommitted startup/protocol state before recovery verification.
- There were no untracked files and no changed JSON/NDJSON inputs before doctor refreshed `PROJECT_STATUS.json`; the refreshed JSON parses.
- `~/.claude.json` passes native JSON parsing, and the canonical guard reports zero corruption events in the prior 24 hours.
- The first `npm test` red was one fixed-timeout failure, not an assertion mismatch. The exact test passed alone in 0.9 seconds and the next direct full run passed 134/134 files, 822/822 tests, 31/31 server files, and 121/121 server tests.
- Project doctor directly passed seven executable checks with `blockingFailing: 0`.

## 2026-07-21 — Session 78 product-truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-21.json` contains 9 items: 7 shipped locally and 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`; no pending unblocked item remains.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 11/11 evidence-derived innovations shipped, including external-block taxonomy parity and local-theme-proof freshness enforcement.
- Prediction League resolution now consumes only certified match progression evidence and is process-idempotent; its receipt records actual outcome and resolved prediction count.
- First-run truth has one shared four-action First Extraction vocabulary; advanced coachmarks cannot appear or complete before it clears; two unmounted client tutorial paths were removed.
- Convoy Mastery persists one typed prescription across recap, debrief, and HUD; malformed local state fails closed.
- Startup brief truth reports `Last active: 0d` and `Avg3: 980.3` from typed evidence; impossible activity ages are semantic failures.
- All 10 manifest pages are generator-owned and pass idempotent shell check plus scoped 4-header/7-footer validation.
- `docs/THEME_LOCAL_PROOF.json` contains six local-only theme/viewport cells and twelve captured surfaces. Every checked token pair exceeds 4.5 contrast; the doctor rejects stale, incomplete, low-contrast, or non-local claims.
- Full verification passed: 139 main files / 840 tests, independent 32 server files / 124 tests, TypeScript, production Vite build, focused Playwright theme matrix, Prettier ratchet, work exhaustion, and doctor 8/8 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Cloudflare deploy and Brevo capabilities are READY. No external staging target, parity, native Obelisk, human Alpha, revenue, or founder evidence was fabricated or inferred.
- Closeout helper discovery unexpectedly mutated the Studio Ops default target because `--help` was not side-effect-free. Read-only sibling status identified a dirty tree with concurrent/unknown provenance; Ark cargo `01JU3V1GUP49DF58394CEE8244` reports likely affected paths for owner reconciliation. VaultFront did not edit or revert the sibling directly.

## 2026-07-22 — Session 79 certified-mastery truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-22.json` contains 8 items: 6 shipped locally, 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`, and 0 pending unblocked.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 14/14 evidence-derived innovations shipped; three were generated and implemented this session.
- Daily Mastery reads only authenticated identity and certified match envelopes. PostgreSQL enforces one event per player/game/UTC-day and credits a persistent wallet once; the no-database fallback reports `process-local` scope.
- The browser graph reports 181/181 production client modules reachable and eleven former orphans were deleted. Historical audit prose remains historical evidence, not a runtime claim.
- Every project-status writer passes the atomic-path scanner. Four startup/doctor callers no longer write the JSON directly.
- Coverage enumerates production TypeScript rather than only loaded files: global 29.88% lines / 29.63% statements / 28.57% functions / 24.77% branches; Worker is honestly visible at 0%; ten critical modules have measured floors.
- Release evidence reports work `exhausted=true`, transfer `pass`, and launch `blocked` on eight real observations/dirty-source state. It no longer misclassifies evidenced external corridors as pending work.
- Direct verification passed: 143 Vitest files / 856 tests, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, 26/26 Playwright desktop/mobile tests, 38 deploy-contract checks, and project doctor 10/10 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Remote E2E bootstrap is corrected locally but no post-push GitHub run is claimed green yet.
- No external staging, native Obelisk relying-party, project-domain Brevo delivery, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback observation, or founder approval was fabricated.

## 2026-07-22 — Session 80 durable-evidence truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-22.json` contains 11 items: 9 shipped locally across Sessions 79–80, 2 explicitly `externally-blocked`, and 0 pending unblocked.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` reports 17/17 evidence-derived innovations shipped; three retention/risk/validator invariants were generated and implemented this session.
- Alpha evidence is durable only when PostgreSQL is available. A configured-but-unavailable database fails closed; an unconfigured development runtime reports `process-local`.
- Public playtest summaries omit actor keys, session IDs, and event IDs; release gates read a 24-hour cohort, while stored actor-bound evidence expires after 30 days.
- The live route inventory reports 42 mutation registrations and 42 declared policies. Public ingestion is 11/11 against its explicit reviewed ceiling.
- Dependabot exemption requires exact bot identity plus ecosystem-specific file scope. The workflow loads its validator from the pull request base SHA with `persist-credentials: false`; substantive CI is not bypassed.
- Direct verification passed: 147 Vitest files / 873 tests, production coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, bundle budgets, 26/26 Playwright tests, 41 deploy-contract checks, and project doctor 11/11 with `blockingFailing: 0`.
- Cloudflare deploy/DNS and Brevo capabilities resolve READY, but both available Cloudflare tokens returned HTTP 403 for Email Routing rules. Delivery remains unverified rather than inferred.
- No external staging, native Obelisk relying-party, project-domain delivery, distinct-human Alpha, live-web/revenue/rollback, or founder approval was fabricated.

## 2026-07-23 — Session 81 certified-loop truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-23.json` is exhausted at 6/6 shipped with zero pending unblocked items.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is exhausted at 20/20; three consensus/risk/composition candidates were generated and implemented this session.
- Scheduled public free-for-all, team, special, and ranked configurations enable both VaultFront feature flags; private configuration remains explicit.
- Seasonal contract and loop-evidence writes derive from certified match outcomes. Browser mutation endpoints return 410 and cannot create authoritative progress.
- PostgreSQL stores enforce replay/idempotency; an unavailable configured database fails closed. Database-free development receipts say `process-local` rather than persistent.
- Prediction League uses authenticated actor identity, game/player uniqueness, a shared per-game advisory lock for submit/resolve, durable private stats, and aggregate consensus without exposing participant identity.
- Mutation inventory reports 42/42 routes classified and public ingestion 10/10. Worker reports 4,028 physical lines against a 4,040 ceiling; extracted route literals are forbidden from returning.
- Release evidence reports work exhausted and transfer budgets passing, but remains blocked because staging, runtime health, parity, email, identity, human, live-web, revenue, rollback, and founder observations are absent.
- Direct verification passed: 155 Vitest files / 904 tests, production-inclusive coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, bundle budgets, 26/26 Playwright, and 41 deploy checks.
- The local tree contains a valid but mislabeled preexisting Session 81 commit; no reset, amend, force-push, or fabricated provenance was used.
- A sibling Studio Ops release-gate file was changed by an accidentally invoked generator. VaultFront did not edit or revert the sibling; Ark owns the correction handoff.

## 2026-07-23 — Session 82 entitlement and balance truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-23.json` is cumulatively exhausted at 10/10 shipped; every new premise was rechecked against live code before implementation.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is evidence-derived and exhausted at 25/25; five new second-order candidates were generated and implemented this session.
- Protobufjs is exactly 7.6.5, the lock integrity is pinned, CI audits at moderate severity, and `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Season Pass state derives from certified player/game results. PostgreSQL owns replay keys, aggregates, and cosmetic entitlement claims; actor-bound routes reject cross-player reads/writes and configured persistence failure returns unavailable rather than falling back.
- Convoy reward defaults and formula have one executable authority. The public envelope is byte-stable, verifies 28,125 deterministic scenarios across six invariants with zero counterexamples, and its source/artifact digests participate in tamper-sensitive release lineage.
- Experiment summaries truthfully label assignment and aggregate storage as process-local with a worker-restart reset boundary. Worker is 3,108 physical lines against a 3,130 ceiling; five extracted domains are reclamation-checked.
- Release evidence reports work exhausted and transfer budgets passing. It remains blocked on eight absent external observations plus dirty source before commit; local success is not staging, human, email, identity, theme, or approval evidence.
- Direct verification passed: 160 Vitest files / 923 tests, 31.57% production-inclusive line coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, exact bundle/media budgets, 26/26 Playwright, 42/42 mutation policies, 10/10 public ingest, and zero npm vulnerabilities.

## 2026-07-24 — Session 83 progression and pressure truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-24.json` is exhausted at 4/4 shipped; six attractive premises were rejected against live code or absent external evidence.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is evidence-derived and exhausted at 28/28; three receipt/catalog/rules invariants were generated and implemented this session.
- Certified progression coalesces concurrent player/game attempts, releases failures for retry, serializes PostgreSQL writes with an advisory lock, and enforces one match-history row per player/game. Completion receipts carry a stable digest and tamper verification.
- Achievement progress reads authenticate the player, reject cross-player claims, and are isolated behind an injected router included in the Worker composition contract.
- State-scope readiness distinguishes store capability from effective runtime scope, fingerprints the capability catalog, and blocks contradictory owner/capability declarations instead of rendering plausible stale prose.
- Vault Pressure open/expiry/final-tick/victory transitions are pure and deterministic. The three-delivery threshold and 900-tick window come from the versioned balance authority consumed by runtime and the 28,125-scenario public envelope.
- Worker is 3,098 physical lines against 3,130; VaultFrontExecution is exactly 2,917 formatter-stable lines against its new composition ceiling; mutation policy is 42/42 and public ingest 10/10.
- Direct verification passed: 165 Vitest files / 935 tests, production-inclusive coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, exact bundle/media budgets, 26/26 Playwright desktop/mobile, and 41 deploy-contract checks.
- Release remains NO-GO. Credential readiness did not authorize provider mutation, and no staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder-approval evidence was inferred.

## 2026-07-24 — Session 84 feedback, balance, replay, and lifecycle truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-24.json` is exhausted at 8/8 shipped; every admitted premise was verified against live code before implementation.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is evidence-derived and exhausted at 32/32; four privacy/cohort/replay/lifecycle invariants were generated and implemented this session.
- Match feedback requires an actor- and map-matching certified result, deduplicates certificate replays, labels PostgreSQL versus process-local scope, prunes at 30 days, and publishes no raw player-text aggregate.
- Certified outcomes own result, duration, progression history, and career style; client-authored win/duration/style writes are retired.
- Fifteen gameplay domains derive from one versioned authority. Runtime and the 28,125-scenario envelope consume the same projection; replay HMAC coverage includes its exact canonical identity and rejects incompatible signed rulesets.
- Post-match lifecycle receipts are exactly once and classify completed, timed-out, failed, and cancelled tasks; health derives from those outcomes rather than optimistic render state.
- Worker is 3,064 physical lines against 3,130; VaultFrontExecution is 2,907/2,907; WinModal is 2,384/2,400; PostMatchSession is 234/240; mutation policy is 41/41 and public ingest 10/10.
- Direct verification passed: 173 Vitest files / 960 tests, 32.57% production-inclusive line coverage, TypeScript, ESLint, production build, Prettier ratchet, exact bundle/media budgets, performance benchmarks, 26/26 Playwright, and 41 deploy-contract checks.
- Release remains NO-GO. Credential readiness did not authorize provider mutation, and no staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web/theme, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder-approval evidence was inferred.

- Closeout supply-chain root fix: trusted ESLint 10 / compatibility 2 / EJS 6 shipped; 18 dead assignments/error-chain defects surfaced by the stricter rules were repaired; `vite-plugin-html` and 39 transitive packages were removed; the proprietary package is `private`; and semantic-release explicitly omits npm publishing. `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=moderate` reports zero production vulnerabilities. The all-dependency audit still reports one high and eight moderate aliases solely inside semantic-release's bundled npm 11; the only registry force-fix is an unsafe semantic-release 15 downgrade, while patched npm 12 is outside the verified Node 20/24.14 matrix. This is an evidenced upstream deferral, not a green claim.

## 2026-07-26 — Session 85 continuation and share-authority truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-25.json` is exhausted at 3/3 shipped after every admitted premise was verified against live code; five attractive false or externally unevidenced premises were recorded as rejections.
- `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is source-derived and exhausted at 36/36; four new invariants cover evidence-keyed replay caching, archived certificate binding, post-match route evidence taxonomy, and deterministic epsilon ordering.
- Rematch authorization binds the verified actor to either the live GameServer roster or the archived result-certificate roster before an existing corridor can be joined or a private configuration cloned.
- Prediction admission is a pure non-mutating GameServer signal. Invented, not-started, and closed games cannot reach durable prediction writes; the response does not enumerate private lifecycle state.
- Replay share identity derives from the verified HMAC-covered manifest, exact bounded turn range, kind, and contract version. The same evidence produces the same URL across restarts; unsigned, out-of-range, altered, or mismatched projections fail closed.
- The first full suite red was a real asymmetric epsilon defect, not masked flake. The comparator now applies symmetric equivalence and the test uses deterministic seeded/adversarial evidence. The next direct full run passed 176/176 files and 972/972 tests.
- Local E2E passed 26/26 across desktop, mobile, and three-theme proof, but remains local-only evidence. Release stays blocked on approved staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, and founder approval.

## 2026-07-27 — Session 86 truth refresh

- **Verified:** audit sidecar is exhausted 4/4; innovation sidecar is exhausted 37/37.
- **Verified:** full Vitest suite is 179 files / 978 tests; Playwright is 26/26; lint, format ratchet, production build, balance envelope, and bundle budgets pass.
- **Verified:** mutation policy remains 41/41 with ten public-ingest routes; Worker and execution composition budgets pass.
- **Claim boundary:** local build/E2E/theme evidence remains local-only. No approved staging origin, live email/identity/web parity, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback observation, or founder launch approval was produced.
- **Release decision:** public-unlaunched / NO-GO is unchanged and source-derived.

## 2026-07-27 — Session 87 authority and closeout truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-27.json` is exhausted at 6/6 shipped; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is monotonic and exhausted at 38/38 with no pending unblocked local work.
- Certified tournament advancement is contingent on durable persistence and restores authoritative memory on write failure. Archived certificates require exact unique client roster equality, reject duplicate persistent identities, and fail closed on incomplete or repeated winner mapping.
- Memory and PostgreSQL Elo paths both consume current matches played; canonical player copy describes the executable four-delivery Breach loop; regeneration preserves rank 38; CI blocks production dependency risk while keeping dev-only advisory truth visible.
- Direct verification passed: 181 Vitest files / 990 tests; 33.08% lines / 32.71% statements; TypeScript; ESLint; Prettier ratchet; 41/41 mutation policies; public ingest 10/10; 41 deploy checks; production build; 28,125 balance scenarios; bundle/media/performance budgets; production npm audit zero; Playwright 26/26.
- Release evidence remains NO-GO on nine missing/dirty observations. Commit is expected to resolve dirty-source state only; no approved staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web, distinct-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder approval was inferred.

## 2026-07-28 — Session 88 runtime, delivery, and decisive-loop truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-28.json` has items 96–103 shipped and complete; item 104 remains externally blocked. `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is exhausted at 41/41 with no pending unblocked local work.
- Master health derives from fresh typed worker-internal quorum evidence. Pages validates and uploads one deterministic `static` artifact. Hosted workflow cron is zero and guarded by a repository census.
- Both contact leaves use the project-domain action; human-action aging consumes the canonical task-board parser and preserves durable ages when representation is unknown.
- First Extraction and certified match evidence share Capture → outcome → Pressure → Breach → decisive delivery. Aggregate funnel persistence contains conversion/timing only and no actor identifiers.
- The tracked map-generator binary and unused runtime dependencies are absent; production dependency count fell from 252 to 219 and the production audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Registry-delta Ark cargo `01JUJNSAUUE4626BC279319392` was shipped; no applied acknowledgement exists yet, so external identity coherence is not claimed.
- Direct verification passed across 184 Vitest files / 1,013 tests, TypeScript, ESLint, formatting, contracts, production build, Pages, bundle, and production audit gates. Full E2E was 25/26 after one reload timeout; the exact isolated failed theme test passed.
- Release remains public-unlaunched / NO-GO. Local proof does not establish approved staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live-web, three-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, or founder approval.

## 2026-07-29 — Session 89 chronology, startup, routing, and offline-release truth audit

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-29.json` is exhausted at 4/4 shipped; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is monotonic and exhausted at 45/45 with zero pending unblocked work.
- Certified Pressure → Breach → decisive delivery → victory is a complete nondecreasing prefix. Invalid intervals/ticks, gaps, and time reversal fail before process-local or PostgreSQL persistence; accepted results carry a match-bound SHA-256 admissibility receipt without actor identifiers.
- Matchmaking and rematch allocation share one eight-character alphabet-preserving worker preimage authority. Successful witnesses bind worker ID, seed budget, attempts, candidate count, route, and collision state and are rechecked before consumption.
- Startup brief render time and source-closeout chronology are distinct; unknown runway is unverified; tests/deploy/HUMAN PRESSURE are explicit; freshness schema v2 fingerprints every core local input and tracks missing-to-present transitions.
- Production emits exactly one executable hashed `sw-*.js`; the previous TypeScript data URL is contract-forbidden. Cache cleanup is VaultFront-prefix-only, requests are scope/origin classified, and release lineage binds the exact worker bytes/cache namespace.
- Direct verification passed: 187 Vitest files / 1,040 tests with coverage; TypeScript; ESLint; Prettier; 41/41 mutation policy; public ingest 10/10; Worker 3,128/3,130; 41 deploy checks; deterministic 28,125-scenario balance; production build; Pages 10/10 and service-worker 1/1; exact bundle/media budgets; performance; production audit zero; Playwright 26/26.
- Release evidence remains NO-GO on absent approved staging/parity, project-domain delivery, native Obelisk, live theme/web, three-human Alpha, revenue, rollback, and founder approval. Dirty-source is expected before commit and is not conflated with those external facts.
- Registry `type` correction remains externally owned: acknowledgement `01JUJOJL1K040B6517CAF2EFA9` rejected the delta as `field-not-allowed`; local `type: game` remains source truth pending an owner-supported Ark path.

## 2026-08-23 — Session 108 exact-release truth refresh

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-23.json` is exhausted at 5/5 shipped; `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` is exhausted at 70/70.
- Exact implementation `1a89688c83ce9180db7fdd4d939b21ad854c1a5f` passed provider CI `32624397469` and E2E `32624397463` with 30/30 journeys.
- Stable staging deploy `32624581625` is healthy with 2/2 workers at immutable image `sha256:720b0cad2478d894ad136185617e003bd73943ab6f1d609c117fcb11cd0a8780`.
- Observation `32624675990` passes all nine theme/viewport cells with zero findings; worst LCP is 1,556 ms, INP 184 ms, and CLS 0.0066. Rollback/restoration `32624833208` and promotion dry-run `32624982318` pass.
- The local full-suite attempts remained worker-start starved and are not called green; clean provider CI is the aggregate authority for 288 files / 1,501 assertions.
- Production remains HTTP 503 / NO-GO. Zoho reply identity, authenticated Obelisk, three genuine authenticated human Alpha sessions, positive live revenue, and portable exact-artifact founder approval are absent and were not inferred.

## 2026-08-26 — Session 111 canonical mobile-parity truth refresh

- `docs/AUDIT_2026-08-25.json` is exhausted at item 248 shipped; the innovation ledger remains exhausted at 70/70.
- Exact candidate `7fbaedcdd83be3a58b4865c5ce863dff8d14d963` passed provider CI `32943036547`, E2E `32943036503`, Release `32943036515`, and stable-staging deploy `32943456027` at image `sha256:6c261f221b1cfb70c550844b781d5ebf3da9bbc1ecd18935b909b361e7e42470`.
- Signed observation `32943706016` passes 27/27 theme/viewport/orientation cells with zero findings; worst LCP is 1,224 ms, INP 152 ms, CLS 0.0151, and drawer invariant failures zero. The project-level CANON-041 attestation is complete; the nonzero portfolio probe describes sibling repositories outside this workspace.
- Source-bound rendered proof covers 144 artifacts and six language-modal cells. Promotion dry-run `32944257053`, rollback dry-run `32944355303`, and observed rollback/restoration `32944435452` pass; stable staging is restored to the exact candidate.
- Local Windows processes stalled before typecheck/test assertions and are not called green. Exact provider CI is the aggregate authority for 1,520 assertions and all unchanged verification gates.
- Production remains HTTP 503 / NO-GO. Zoho reply identity, authenticated Obelisk, three genuine authenticated human Alpha sessions, positive live revenue, and portable exact-artifact founder approval are absent and were not inferred.
