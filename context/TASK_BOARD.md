- [release-evidence] Establish an approved external staging origin, then collect exact-digest parity, Brevo, Obelisk, live web/theme, three-human Alpha, revenue, and founder-approval evidence in that order.

## Completed (2026-07-21 — Session 77 interrupted-start recovery)

- Reconstructed Session 77 as cut off during `/start`, not during implementation or closeout.
- Verified Session 76 product work is committed at `22c2b3a6`; separated it from Session 77's uncommitted protocol/Canon refresh.
- Proved structured/config integrity, classified the one timing timeout with isolated and full reruns, and restored a direct green suite plus doctor `blockingFailing: 0` without weakening a gate.

## Completed (2026-07-19 — Session 75 complete saturated arc)

All 14 newly premise-verified findings in `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-16.json` shipped, exhausting the cumulative audit at 37/37. The session then generated and shipped three new second-order candidates, bringing `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json` to 6/6.

Key outcomes: quorum-attested match certificates; exact game-create authority and capacity; database/state-scope readiness; bounded server-sent events; certificate-grounded artificial intelligence inputs and response receipts; an accessible lazy-loaded Command Center with feature-liveness proof; privacy-safe notifications; digest-deduplicated status projection; an executable high-risk route policy manifest; coherent task/brief provenance; closed Windows spawn bypasses; immutable deployment contracts; a Human + Agent capability reachability manifest; and a self-verifying release-evidence lineage graph.

Verification: 134/134 main Vitest files and 814/814 tests plus an independent 31-file / 119-test server repeat; 24/24 desktop/mobile Playwright; lint; typecheck; production build; formatting, exact gzip/Brotli/media bundle budgets, deterministic performance benchmarks, Canon/startup protocol checks, and project doctor `blockingFailing: 0`. Audit 37/37 and innovations 6/6 are shipped.

- [release-evidence] Deploy the exact verified digest to a real staging origin and verify parity.
- [release-evidence] Collect authenticated evidence from at least three distinct human Alpha Gate sessions; test or agent events cannot substitute.
- [release-evidence] Configure and verify project-domain Brevo delivery to the studio inbox.
- [release-evidence] Wire and verify native Obelisk relying-party authentication.
- [release-evidence] Verify live Content Security Policy / HTTP Strict Transport Security, Core Web Vitals, and every theme with screenshots.
- [release-evidence] Observe a real checkout/supporter event before changing revenue status.
- [release-evidence] Obtain founder approval before any SPARKED transition or public announcement.

## Completed (2026-07-16 — Session 74 saturated integrity arc)

All 11 newly verified findings in `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-16.json` shipped; the complete audit is exhausted at 23/23, followed by all 3/3 second-order innovation candidates in `docs/INNOVATION_PACK.json`.

Key outcomes: server-authoritative mutation authorization, experiment-integrity enforcement, bounded WebSockets, process-local worker-health watermarks, truthful project doctor, audit-driven Genius List, release/security-header truth, warning-free cycle-free production chunks, transfer/cardinality budgets, provider-bound remote-AI reservations, Runtime Integrity Passport, Release Evidence Manifest, and machine-checked work exhaustion.

Verification: 122 files / 762 unique Vitest tests plus an independent 25-file / 90-test server pass; 22/22 desktop/mobile Playwright; lint; typecheck; production build; formatting and bundle ratchets; sitemap 10/10; Canon zero gaps; doctor `blockingFailing: 0`; audit 23/23 and innovations 3/3 shipped.

- [release-evidence] Collect authenticated evidence from at least three distinct human staging sessions; test or agent events cannot substitute.
- [release-evidence] Configure and verify project-domain Brevo delivery to the studio inbox.
- [release-evidence] Wire and verify native Obelisk relying-party authentication.
- [release-evidence] Verify live CSP/HSTS, Core Web Vitals, and every theme with screenshots after a real staging origin exists.
- [release-evidence] Observe a real checkout/supporter event before changing revenue status.
- [release-evidence] Obtain founder approval before any SPARKED transition or public announcement.

## Completed (2026-07-16 — Session 73 full arc)

All 12 items from `docs/AUDIT_2026-07-16.json` shipped, followed by all 3 evidence-detected second-order innovation candidates. The arc added authenticated Alpha Gate evidence, signed replay enforcement, real private-lobby rematches, Vault Pressure, deterministic coaching, a remote-AI cost firewall, readiness truth, authoritative progression, CI/coverage/format/bundle ratchets, protocol recovery guards, a hardened public surface, and a zero-vulnerability dependency train.

Verification: 107/107 files and 697/697 tests; 22/22 Playwright tests under the exact CI profile; production build/typecheck; lint; coverage, formatting, and bundle ratchets; `npm audit` zero; Studio supply-chain scan zero matches; sitemap 10/10; Canon conformance zero gaps; Studio doctor `overallPass: true` and `blockingFailing: 0`.

- [done] [SIL] Reconcile registry/local project profile — local truth is now `game/public-unlaunched`; signed Ark correction cargo `01JTM66B6TEE83C483CEB936FA` requests registry `app → game` without weakening the launch posture.
- [done] [SIL] Add recovery-provenance classification — deterministic classifier and protocol tests distinguish backup residue, propagation, and current-session artifacts.
- [release-evidence] Run the authenticated Alpha Gate on staging with at least three distinct human sessions; automated/test evidence cannot satisfy it.
- [release-evidence] Observe a real checkout/supporter event before changing the revenue signal from unverified.
- [SIL] Replace the remaining Rollup circular-chunk warning and mixed JSON import-attribute warnings with a cycle-free lazy boundary while preserving per-chunk budgets.
- [SIL] Execute the staging launch-evidence corridor: Brevo delivery, native Obelisk relying-party auth, strict live headers/Core Web Vitals, and multi-theme screenshot verification.

## Completed (2026-07-16 — Session 72 recovery closeout)

Recovered and verified the interrupted post-S71 tree: retained the validated Studio protocol/Canon/Dependabot propagation, removed incompatible/unreferenced Obelisk helpers from deployable `src/`, untracked the local ignored passport cargo so quarantine is real, preserved the rights ledger locally while removing it from the public index, and proved the boundary with 94 files / 655 tests plus 10 server files / 30 tests and Studio doctor `blockingFailing: 0`.

- [SIL] Reconcile registry `app/public-unlaunched` metadata with local `game/internal` project truth so audit and release gates consume one intentional profile.
- [SIL] Add a recovery-provenance check that distinguishes `lint-staged` backup residue, propagated protocol files, and current-session generated artifacts.

## Completed (2026-06-14 — Session 71 /audit + /implement pass)

All 3 items from `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14_S71.md` shipped: `obelisk-passport-quarantine`, `protocol-helper-regression-harness`, and `s71-truth-sync`. Verification passed with focused Studio helper Vitest, startup brief render/validation, compact handoff, secrets audit, blocker preflight, PROJECT_STATUS invariant check, broad `npm test` (94 files / 655 tests plus 10 server files / 30 tests), and `npm run build-prod`.

- Keep generated `obelisk-passport/` local until the relying-party production origin is registered and the login/callback/server verify path is intentionally wired.
- Keep the HUMAN PRESSURE startup block as a recommended future renderer improvement; current validation remains conformant without it.

## Unified Genius List (2026-06-13 — Session 70 /go)

- [done] 🔥 feedback_loop / automation · 20m · Alpha Gate Passport verification smoke — **DONE S70**: focused pulse/readiness/sidebar Vitest passed 14 tests after protocol repair.
- [done] ⚡ process / truth · 20m · Document next alpha-gate operator action — **DONE S70**: task board synced append-only, startup brief regenerated, and `validate-task-ids` passed.
- [done] ⚡ capital_efficiency / truth · 20m · Keep revenue warning honest — **DONE S70**: startup brief still reports revenue signal as blocked/unverified and broad `npm test` passed.
- [done] ⚡ dev_health / automation · 20m · Production build regression gate — **DONE S70**: `npm run build-prod` passed after `/go` helper repair.
- [release-evidence] 🔥 feedback_loop / launch · 1h · Manual rivalry/rematch alpha playtest — requires real tester/manual playtest evidence.
- [release-evidence] ⚠ capital_efficiency / revenue · manual · Observe live checkout/supporter event — requires real checkout/supporter telemetry.

## Completed (2026-06-14 — Session 70 /audit + /implement pass)

All 3 items from `docs/AUDIT_2026-06-14.md` shipped: `alpha-gate-operator-runbook`, `go-helper-regression-smoke`, and `readiness-alpha-evidence-copy`. Verification passed with focused Vitest, `npx tsc --noEmit`, production build, and broad `npm test` (93 files / 652 tests plus 10 server files / 30 tests).

- Use the KPI Alpha Gate strip during the next rivalry/rematch alpha gate; do not mark the live playtest complete until all five `alphaGate.checks` are green from real tester evidence.

- ~~Run a focused internal rivalry/rematch playtest and inspect the new pulse fields: `retentionChallengeShown`, `retentionRequeued`, `retentionRematchRequested`, and `rates.retentionAction`.~~ ✅ Instrumented for the next playtest (Session 68 adds `operatorNext`, KPI Rival action %, and latest signal age).
- ~~Fix unrelated global lint blockers in e2e/project-service config and Studio script lint debt.~~ ✅ Done
- ~~Fix pre-existing `src/server/Master.ts(166,30)` type error~~ ✅ Done
- ~~Run `npm run build-prod` and `npm run e2e` after this readiness pass to promote tournament playtest confidence.~~ ✅ Done (`build-prod` green; CI-style serial E2E green with one flaky retry)
- Wire a live revenue signal into the startup brief once checkout or supporter telemetry is observable.
- ~~Repair broad `npm test` residuals: `VaultFrontExecution` mock/BigInt failures and `CoachHintEngine` trigger-field assertion.~~ ✅ Done (Session 64 — all 90 test files / 637 tests green)
- ~~Consider a compact/mobile tutorial pattern that teaches VaultFront mechanics without a modal overlay.~~ ✅ Done (Session 65 — first-run mobile strip with tutorial pulse telemetry)
- ~~Run a mobile tutorial smoke in browser to verify strip placement against the live control panel.~~ ✅ Automated compact-width component smoke added in Session 66; manual browser playtest still useful before a public flip.
- Use the `operatorNext` script in `/api/vaultfront/playtest-pulse/summary` during the next internal rivalry/rematch alpha gate.
- Use the KPI Playtest Pulse tile to inspect Rival action %, latest signal age, and the next operator action after the next internal playtest.
- Use readiness `playtest-pulse` action insights as the next alpha gate; stale evidence, tutorial, feedback, and retention warnings should name the next action directly.
- Keep startup helper-chain drift on the next closeout radar; compact handoff and startup render are green after S66 helper restores.
- Observe a real checkout/supporter event and set `VAULTFRONT_REVENUE_OBSERVED=1` only after evidence exists.

## Deferred to Project Agents
