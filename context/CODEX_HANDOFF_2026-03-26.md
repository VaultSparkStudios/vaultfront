## Pending (manual/infrastructure)

### DEFERRED: npm install of new dev dependencies
The following packages were configured in code but NOT installed (deferred to next session):
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test bundlewatch \
  @semantic-release/commit-analyzer @semantic-release/release-notes-generator \
  @semantic-release/changelog @semantic-release/github
npx playwright install chromium
```
Tracked in: `context/TASK_BOARD.md` → MANUAL item 0.
Until run: E2E tests, bundle size CI job, and semantic release workflow will fail.

### DEFERRED: Deploy Runtime
All 8 steps in `docs/DEPLOY_RUNTIME_RUNBOOK.md` require manual execution
(VPS provisioning, secrets, DNS, Postgres, deploy trigger).
Tracked in: `context/TASK_BOARD.md` → MANUAL items 2–8.

## Updated files index
- `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` — updated with session changes
- `docs/VAULTFRONT_SOURCE_MAP.md` — updated with all new files
