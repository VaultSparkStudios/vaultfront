# VaultFront Runtime Deployment Runbook

This runbook covers the 8 manual steps required to bring the VaultFront gameplay
runtime online. The CI/CD pipeline (`deploy.yml`, `promote.yml`) handles all
subsequent deployments automatically — this runbook only needs to be executed once
per environment.

**Target URLs:**

- Gameplay: `https://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com`
- API: `https://api-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com`
- Public page: `https://vaultsparkstudios.com/vaultfront/` (already live)

---

## Prerequisites

- Hetzner account with billing enabled
- Cloudflare account with `vaultsparkstudios.com` zone access
- GitHub org admin access to `VaultSparkStudios/VaultFront`
- GHCR write access (to push Docker images)
- Local: `ssh-keygen`, `hcloud` CLI, `gh` CLI

---

## Step 1 — Provision the VPS

**Spec:** 4 vCPU / 8 GB RAM / 80 GB disk — Hetzner CX32 or equivalent.

```bash
# Using hcloud CLI (Hetzner)
hcloud server create \
  --name vaultfront-runtime \
  --type cx32 \
  --image ubuntu-24.04 \
  --location nbg1 \
  --ssh-key your-key-name
```

Note the server's public IPv4 address — needed in Steps 3 and 4.

**Manual Hetzner UI path:**
Servers → Create Server → Ubuntu 24.04 → CX32 → Nuremberg → Add SSH key → Create

---

## Step 2 — Prepare the VPS

SSH in and run:

```bash
ssh root@<VPS_IP>

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
systemctl enable --now docker

# Install Caddy
apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' \
  | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' \
  | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
apt update && apt install -y caddy

# Install Postgres + Redis
apt install -y postgresql redis-server
systemctl enable --now postgresql redis-server

# Create app user and deploy directory
useradd -m -s /bin/bash vaultfront
mkdir -p /opt/vaultfront
chown vaultfront:vaultfront /opt/vaultfront

# Allow vaultfront user to run docker
usermod -aG docker vaultfront
```

Upload the deploy scripts:

```bash
# From your local machine
scp update.sh root@ < VPS_IP > :/opt/vaultfront/update.sh
ssh root@ < VPS_IP > "chmod +x /opt/vaultfront/update.sh"
```

## Step 3 — Configure GitHub Secrets

In the GitHub UI: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add the following **Secrets**:

| Secret                        | Value                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEPLOY_SERVER_HOST`          | VPS public IPv4 from Step 1                         |
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`              | Private SSH key content for the VPS deploy user     |
| `GHCR_TOKEN`                  | GitHub PAT with `write:packages` scope              |
| `API_KEY`                     | Internal API key shared with api-vaultfront service |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`               | Cloudflare account ID                               |
| `CF_API_TOKEN`                | Cloudflare API token with Tunnel + DNS write scope  |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`        | Cloudflare Turnstile secret for the domain          |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Your observability endpoint (or leave blank)        |
| `OTEL_AUTH_HEADER`            | Auth header for OTEL (or leave blank)               |

Add the following **Variables**:

| Variable                    | Value                          |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DOMAIN`                    | `vaultsparkstudios.com`        |
| `GHCR_REPO`                 | `vaultsparkstudios/vaultfront` |
| `GHCR_USERNAME`             | Your GHCR org username         |
| `DEPLOY_REMOTE_USER`        | `vaultfront`                   |
| `DEPLOY_REMOTE_SCRIPT_PATH` | `/opt/vaultfront/update.sh`    |

---

## Step 4 — Configure Postgres and Redis

```bash
ssh vaultfront@<VPS_IP>

# Postgres: create vaultfront DB and user
sudo -u postgres psql <<EOF
CREATE USER vaultfront WITH PASSWORD 'changeme';
CREATE DATABASE vaultfront OWNER vaultfront;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vaultfront TO vaultfront;
EOF

# Test connection
psql -U vaultfront -d vaultfront -c "SELECT 1;"

# Redis: verify it's running
redis-cli ping  # should return PONG
```

Update `/opt/vaultfront/.env` with:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://vaultfront:changeme@localhost:5432/vaultfront
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

---

## Step 5 — Configure DNS Records

In Cloudflare DNS for `vaultsparkstudios.com`:

| Type | Name              | Content    | Proxy   |
| ---- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| `A`  | `play-vaultfront` | `<VPS_IP>` | Proxied |
| `A`  | `api-vaultfront`  | `<VPS_IP>` | Proxied |

Or if using Cloudflare Tunnels (recommended for zero-trust):

```bash
# On VPS — create tunnels via cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel create vaultfront-play
cloudflared tunnel route dns vaultfront-play play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com

cloudflared tunnel create vaultfront-api
cloudflared tunnel route dns vaultfront-api api-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com
```

---

## Step 6 — Configure Caddy

Write `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` (or use `docs/templates/Caddyfile.studio-backend.template`):

```caddyfile
play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  encode gzip
}

api-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com {
  reverse_proxy localhost:3000
  encode gzip
}
```

```bash
caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

---

## Step 7 — Trigger the Deploy Workflow

The **Deploy staging** workflow is staging-only. It cannot promote production.

1. Go to GitHub Actions → **Deploy staging**.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. Set:
   - `target_host`: `staging`
   - `target_subdomain`: `staging`
   - `dry_run`: `true`
4. Run the workflow and require the repository contract plus dry-run to pass.
5. After the dry-run is green, rerun the same inputs with `dry_run: false`.

A non-dry staging run:

- validates `scripts/check-deploy-contract.mjs`
- builds and pushes an immutable GitHub Container Registry image
- deploys the digest to the staging host
- verifies `/commit.txt` equals the workflow commit SHA

Record the immutable `sha256:...` image digest from the successful staging run.

### Promote the verified staging digest

1. Go to GitHub Actions → **Promote verified digest**.
2. Click **Run workflow**.
3. Set:
   - `image_digest`: the exact immutable digest deployed to staging
   - `staging_evidence_digest`: the same digest recorded by staging verification
   - `target_subdomain`: `play-vaultfront`
   - `dry_run`: `true`
4. Run the promotion validation and require its digest equality check to pass.
5. Only after all release gates and founder approval are recorded, rerun with `dry_run: false`.

Promotion pulls the already-verified image; it does not rebuild source.

Never invoke production deployment through **Deploy staging**, and never substitute a mutable image tag for the digest pair.

---

## Step 8 — Swap Pages to the Real Client

Once the gameplay backend health check passes:

1. Go to GitHub Actions → **Deploy Pages** workflow
2. Change the deploy target from `pages-stub/` to the built `static/` output
3. Update `docs/DEPLOY_PAGES.md` to reflect the live state
4. Update `context/CURRENT_STATE.md` — remove the "Pending" flags for the runtime URLs

Optionally update `pages-stub/index.html` hero text from "Under Development" to
a live link pointing to `https://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com`.

---

## Verification Checklist

Capture a release receipt instead of relying on a green workflow badge alone.

```bash
# Canonical health endpoint
curl https://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com/_health
# Expected: {"status":"ok"}

# Commit SHA matches the revision label embedded in the promoted image
curl https://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com/commit.txt
# Must equal the EXPECTED_GIT_SHA resolved by promote.yml

# Staging observation bundle
# Record the staging URL, image digest, observed time, health response digest,
# parity evidence, and workflow run URL before production promotion.

# WebSocket connectivity (use wscat or browser dev tools)
wscat -c wss://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com/lobbies

# Env config reachable
curl https://play-vaultfront.vaultsparkstudios.com/api/env
```

Before promotion, verify:

- the image digest and staging evidence digest are identical
- staging health, parity, Brevo, Obelisk, theme/web, and Alpha observations are fresh
- `/commit.txt` matches the immutable image revision
- `static/release-evidence.json` remains blocked until every external gate and founder approval is recorded

---

## Rollback

Rollback is a promotion of a previously verified immutable digest, never a mutable tag.

1. Identify the previous known-good `sha256:...` image digest.
2. Confirm the retained staging evidence digest for that image is identical.
3. Go to GitHub Actions → **Promote verified digest**.
4. Set:
   - `image_digest`: the previous known-good digest
   - `staging_evidence_digest`: the matching retained staging digest
   - `target_subdomain`: `play-vaultfront`
   - `dry_run`: `true`
5. Run the validation-only promotion.
6. Require digest validation and `scripts/check-deploy-contract.mjs` to pass.
7. With the rollback decision approved, rerun the same inputs with `dry_run: false`.
8. Verify `/_health`, `/commit.txt`, WebSocket connectivity, and the environment payload.

A rollback must never bypass staging attestation by changing `DEPLOY_STAGING_ATTESTATION` or using `latest`, a branch name, a version tag, or a bare commit SHA.

### Rollback receipt

Record:

- candidate and restored image digests
- matching staging evidence digest
- promotion workflow run URL
- start/end timestamps
- health and revision verification results
- rollback reason and approving operator/founder decision

Rollback duration is measured from workflow start to verified revision, not estimated in advance.
